notes for school written in markdown and LaTeX

font is [open dyslexic](https://opendyslexic.org/) because it feels easier to read.

actually most of the style choices are to make the notes more readable, not look good.

converting markdown into html is done with [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked)

code highlighting is done with [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)

rendering LaTeX is done with [KaTeX](https://katex.org/)
