# protoyping and testing

prototyping is important because:

- it gets ideas out of your head and into a real, visible form
- the low fidelity nature of protoypes makes it easier to test sooner
- prototypes can be used to gather feedback from real users, and iterate

first step of prototyping is to define your purpose

## prototyping is used to:

- explore - done by yourself or kept within a small team, used to create insights and compare options and perspectives
- evaluate - built for potential customers or stakeholders, used to test out hypothesis, gather data, test out ideas by gathering data from the prototype
- communicate - built to persuade/inspire management or key stakeholders, used to convey you ideas when nothing else can effectively inform someone of what the product might be like


## must haves

"If my prototype is non-interactive, nicely polished, and cannot fail, it’s not a prototype - it’s a visual aid."

"A prototype is an early version of the thing. If it describes the thing, you may have a presentation on your hands." - Adam Lawrence

What makes a great prototype:

- **Fail-able** - A great prototype can be tested in action and is able to fail the test in order to teach us something.
- **(inter) Active** - A great prototype can be interacted with, just like we would interact with the final offering. It says, “Try this,” not “Look at this.”
- **Informative** - Prototypes must teach the builder something. If they don’t teach us anything, why did we build them?
- **Lo-Fi** - A great prototype is the lowest meaningful level of fidelity. It’s clear, but often ugly and built to be replaced. 
- **Disposable** - There is never "the" prototype. There is never a "final prototype." There is only "the latest prototype."

## prototype types

- physical - sketches or products, provide a tangible representation of the product
    - sketching - drawing out what te product will look like
    - cardboard mockups - building a physical object or environment out of cheap materials
- digital - digital sketches, models, simulation, or crude app, let stakeholders interact with the service before its finalized
    - paper prototyping - physical sketches of what digital pages will look like
    - interactive click modeling - digital sketches of what the pages will look like, and basic clicking to navigate between pages is implemented
    - wireframing - outlines of where content will go, not very detailed
    - coded prototypes - pretty close to the ready to release version of a product
    - rehearsing digital services - have a human play as the app or web page, plays out as a conversation between people

- experience/process - creating full-scale models of a service, or roleplaying as customers, staff, ect.
