# protoyping and testing

prototyping is important because:

- it gets ideas out of your head and into a real, visible form
- the low fidelity nature of protoypes makes it easier to test sooner
- prototypes can be used to gather feedback from real users, and iterate

first step of prototyping is to define your purpose

## prototyping is used to:

- explore - done by yourself or kept within a small team, used to create insights and compare options and perspectives
- evaluate - built for potential customers or stakeholders, used to test out hypothesis, gather data, test out ideas by gathering data from the prototype
- communicate - built to persuade/inspire management or key stakeholders, used to convey you ideas when nothing else can effectively inform someone of what the product might be like


## must haves

"If my prototype is non-interactive, nicely polished, and cannot fail, it’s not a prototype - it’s a visual aid."

"A prototype is an early version of the thing. If it describes the thing, you may have a presentation on your hands." - Adam Lawrence

What makes a great prototype:

- **Fail-able** - A great prototype can be tested in action and is able to fail the test in order to teach us something.
- **(inter) Active** - A great prototype can be interacted with, just like we would interact with the final offering. It says, “Try this,” not “Look at this.”
- **Informative** - Prototypes must teach the builder something. If they don’t teach us anything, why did we build them?
- **Lo-Fi** - A great prototype is the lowest meaningful level of fidelity. It’s clear, but often ugly and built to be replaced. 
- **Disposable** - There is never "the" prototype. There is never a "final prototype." There is only "the latest prototype."

## prototype types

- physical - sketches or products, provide a tangible representation of the product
    - sketching - drawing out what te product will look like
    - cardboard mockups - building a physical object or environment out of cheap materials
- digital - digital sketches, models, simulation, or crude app, let stakeholders interact with the service before its finalized
    - paper prototyping - physical sketches of what digital pages will look like
    - interactive click modeling - digital sketches of what the pages will look like, and basic clicking to navigate between pages is implemented
    - wireframing - outlines of where content will go, not very detailed
    - coded prototypes - pretty close to the ready to release version of a product
    - rehearsing digital services - have a human play as the app or web page, plays out as a conversation between people
- experience/process - creating full-scale models of a service, or roleplaying as customers, staff, ect.
    - desktop walkthrough - step through the process with small scale props
    - investigative rehearsal - act out behaviours or processes

tools for visualization

- powerpoint
- keynote
- adobe xd
- figma
- sketch
- invision
- micro


## fidelity

fidelity - level of detail and realism, how well it conveys the look and feel of the final product

it can vary in the areas of:

- Visual design
- Content
- Interactivity

prototypes fall in a range between low and high fidelity

### low fidelity prototyping

low fidelity prototyping is focused on providing the fastest possible way to iterate design ideas, used to check and test functionality rather than the visual appearance of the product

characteristics

- visual design - only necessary visual attributes are presented (shape, hierarchy)
- content - only key elements included
- interactivity - prototype can be simulated by a person manually recreating functionality

pros and cons of low fidelity prototypes

pro | con
---|---
Inexpensive: The clear advantage of low-fidelity prototyping is its extremely low cost. | Uncertainty during testing: With a lo-fi prototype, it might be unclear to test participants what’s supposed to work and what isn’t. A low-fidelity prototype requires a lot of imagination from the user, limiting the outcome of user testing.
Fast: It’s possible to create a simple paper prototype in just five to ten minutes. This allows product teams to explore different ideas without too much effort. | Limited interactivity: It’s impossible to convey complex animations, transitions, functionality, or service steps using this type of prototype.
Collaborative: This type of prototyping stimulates group work. Since low-fidelity prototyping doesn’t require special skills, more people can be involved in the design process. Even non-designers can play an active part in the idea-formulation process. |
Clarifying: Both team members and stakeholders will have much clearer expectations about the project. |

## minimum viable service

an MVS is the least you can provide as a service, that will give you the largest amount of learning about users to prove that you're delivering your intended solution and that it delivers value to your audience. 

"Concierging" is a pre-MVP (minimum viable product) prototyping method. It involves manually delivering an aspect of the solution/service with smoke, mirrors, manual effort, cardboard, third-party tools, etc. Often done a few times to address specific risks and assumptions, it’s woefully underexploited in the startup world. This is where MVS comes in.

Take that concierge concept and start to deliver it as a service, an MVS. This doesn’t mean pretending to do it but delivering value and, ideally, getting revenue and real-world insights.

## testing prototypes

- concept testing - used to validate the service early on, find obvious design flaws, gather general feedback 
- usability testing - 
- role play -


## Service Touchpoint Prototype

Now that we’ve talked about different ways to test prototypes at a high level, let’s zoom in on ways to design a service touchpoint prototype. (As a reminder, service touchpoints are the moments where service users interact with the service, for example, the interaction at an airport check-in desk).

Below are ways to design a service touchpoint prototype:

- Incorporate key artifacts
- gather user feedback on prototypes
- incorporate user feedback into design decisions and future iterations
- do multiple Iterations/rounds of prototyping and testing
- Build the future-state service blueprint
