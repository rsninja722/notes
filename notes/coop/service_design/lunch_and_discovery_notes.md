communication, knowing when to step in, and when to step back

- How applicable do you think service design is to smaller scale work such as personal projects, or is service design mainly geared towards businesses?

the full service design process is meant for larger businesses/governments that have the time and resources, for smaller scale projects, it is still useful to apply the principles of service design and human centered design

learning design

not everything needs to be done with service design. learn to identify 

- Has what you have learned from service design helped you in managing a team and becoming a leader?
makes you focus on not expecting perfection
treat everything as a learning experience
incorperate service design in the service design process


- What has you experience been with the difficulties of getting people to change from traditional design to service design 
getting people to be comfortable with not knowing what the exact end product will be
at the end the problem will be addressed vs. at the end yuo will have x problem


- Does perfectionism have a place in service design, or are "perfectionists" more often against making potentially perfectionists
right at the end is where it comes in

iterate and then once you move into continuos improvement perfectionism can come in

making sure people understand what is and isn't the final project, helps people be more comfortable with imperfection

AI is promising tech in learning design

be adaptable

sometimes amazing things can happen when you are forced to take a path you didn't plan on

- interviews

transparency

admit you haven't done the exact job required, but tell how you can learn and apply what you have learned

show how you have learned and continuously improved
