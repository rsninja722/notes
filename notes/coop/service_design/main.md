## glossary
Term | Definition
---|---
Agile Development | An incremental and iterative approach to software development that focuses on people, results, collaboration, and flexible responses to change. 
Backstage Experiences| Actions that an organization takes that are unobservable by the customer but improve front stage experiences.
Brainstorming | A well-known exploration method for quickly generating lots of ideas.
Brainwriting | An alternative to brainstorming where individual participants write down their ideas at the same time, but in silence.
Bodystorming | A physical exploration method where participants role-play some ideas, taking on the roles of various stakeholders or groups. 
Business Model Canvas | A shared language for describing, visualizing, assessing, and changing business models. (According to Business Models Inc.)
Cardboard Mock-up | A prototyping technique where a physical object or environment is created out of materials, such as paper and cardboard, or even foam, plasticine, and duct tape.
Co-Creation | The process of including diverse perspective from customers, employees, prospects, suppliers and competitors in an interactive session to develop ideas.
Co-Creative Workshops | A qualitative research method that involves using the knowledge and experiences of a group working together to understand how customers experience services.
Coded Prototype | A ready-to-release version of a product that allows test participants to explore a product’s different features.
Concept Testing | A testing method that eliminates any obvious design flaws by getting your target audience to evaluate an initial idea or prototype.
Customer Experience (CX) | The sum of all experiences a customer has with a certain product, service, or brand.
Design Maturity | A measure of the level of design sophistication and integration within an organization.
Desk Research | A qualitative research method that involves independent searches using existing sources, research databases, and publications.
Desktop Walkthroughs | A prototyping technique used to simulate the end-to-end customer experience using simple props like toy figurines on a small-scale stage.
Discovery | The processes undertaken to start to understand the problem that needs to be solved so that it addresses a real need.
Empathy Mapping | A collaborative visualization that can be used to gain deeper insight into a group of users or customer segment.
Fidelity | Refers to the level of detail and realism that a prototype uses to convey the look and feel of the final product. Fidelity can range from low to high. 
Five Whys | An interview technique that involves paraphrasing the initial interviewee’s answer approximately five times into questions that start with “why.”
Frontstage Experiences | The experiences a service user has when interacting with the service.
High-Fidelity Prototype | A computer-based interactive representation of a product or service that looks and feels very close to its final design in terms of details and functionality.
Human Centred Design | Designing services where all user’s viewpoints and needs are considered and valued.
Ideation | The process of coming up with ideas to address the challenges uncovered in the discovery stage.
Idea Mash-up | An exploration method used to generate ideas by bringing odd or unexpected things together for the purpose of solving a design problem.
Interactive Click Modelling | A next step from paper prototyping that makes the prototype more realistic to give a more accurate depiction of the digital product being used.
Interview | A qualitative research technique that involves asking open-ended questions to respondents to elicit data about a subject.
Investigative Rehearsal | A prototyping technique that examines behaviours or processes in a structured way by acting them out. 
Journey Map | A visual representation of specific experiences and touchpoints involved in a service.
Low-Fidelity Prototype | A quick and easy way to translate high-level design concepts into tangible and testable artifacts for the purpose of testing a product’s functionality.
Mapping | A key tool that can be used in discovery and also to generate ideas during ideation.
Minimum Viable Service (MVS) | The least you can provide, as a service, that will give you the largest amount of learning about users to prove that you’re delivering the intended solution and that it deliversvalue to your audience.
Non-Participant Research | A qualitative research method that involves not engaging directly with participants but behaving like a “fly on the wall” to collect data. 
North Star Vision | A mental picture of what the service will look like in the future and that sets the direction for design planning and execution.
Participant Research | A qualitative research method that involves engaging directly with participants through focus groups or interviews to gather insights into experiences with a service. 
Paper Prototyping | A prototyping technique based on creating hand drawings of different screens that represent user interfaces of a digital product without using digital software.
Persona | A rich description of a specific fictional person as an archetype exemplifying a group, such as a group of customers, users, or employees.
Problem Framing | A method that forces us to take a step back and look at the big picture of the problem before jumping to solutions.
Prototyping | A real, tactical representation of your best ideas used to gain insights into problem-solutions that were generated in the ideation stage.
Qualitative Research | A broad exploration of people’s experiences and unmet needs that help to identify problems and come up with better solutions down the road.  
Quantitative Research | Methods such as surveys and statistics that are used in more detailed design work once problem framing has been completed. 
Role Play | A type of prototyping or simulation technique that can help to quickly elicit the user experience from the target audience for a product or service.
Sketching  | A prototyping technique where quick, low-fidelity visualizations of an idea are presented to stakeholders for feedback.
Self-Ethnographic Research | A qualitative research method that involves immersing yourself in a service to understand the experiences of the customers.
Service | Help of some sort, whether this is obtained through a product or a skill.
Service Blueprint | Details an organization’s processes, showing how each function interacts with others in the business.
Service Design | An approach to creating services that applies design methods to see the world through the eyes of the customer with an overall goal to deliver better services.
Service Design Model | The process or processes that are followed to create a solution to a problem. 
Speedy 8’s | An idea generation method where participants think broadly about the problem that needs to be solved by sketching eight ideas in eight minutes.
Synthesis | The process of summarizing all the information gathered through research in an output that is easy to share and communicate.
Touchpoint | The interactions a customer has with an organization providing services.
Usability Testing | A testing method where the aim is to measure the effectiveness of the design in terms of usability and user experience (UX). 
User Story | Part of an agile development approach where short, simple descriptions of a feature are told from the perspective of the person who desires the new solution.
Waterfall Development | A linear and sequential approach to software development where specialized tasks are completed and reviewed in one phase before moving to the next phase.
Wireframing | A prototyping technique that shows simple outlines or layout of a digital interface without the detailed content or graphical elements.
