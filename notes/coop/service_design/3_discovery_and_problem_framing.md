# discovery and problem framing

"If I had an hour to solve a problem, I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about the solution." - Albert Einstein

your solution is entirely dependent on how you frame the problem. as a scummy example: if workers in a building are complaining about the wait for the elevator being to long, you can frame the problem in different ways. if you frame the problem as "the wait is too long" then your solution might be something about fixing/upgrading the elevators (big cost). if you frame the problem as "the wait is annoying" then you solution might be something like installing music speakers/tv's/hand sanitizer stations to distract the customers and give them something to do while they wait (much lower cost). the course says that "well-framed problems open a solution space to innovative and effective possibilities" in relation to the cheap solution, gives ya an idea of how the people making business decisions think, "don't improve the product, distract people from the problem".

## service design research 

course definition:

- **qualitative Research** - a broad exploration of peopleâ€™s experiences and unmet needs that help to identify problems and come up with better solutions down the road.  
- **quantitative Research** - methods such as surveys and statistics that are used in more detailed design work once problem framing has been completed. 

basically:

- **qualitative** - qualities and aspects that can't easily be converted to statistical data (hockey example: effort put in a game, how well they work in a team)
- **quantitative** - more general data and statics that is more easily compared and expressed (hokey example: how many shot/scores/passes a player makes)

qualitative research is preferred in the beginning of the service design process so it is possible to discover things outside the scope of what you originally intend to look at

### types of research

- **desk research** - using existing sources such as articles, research databases, and publications. find the research that has already been done on the topic. use all this research to find the right questions, not the right answers
- **self-ethnographic approaches** - immersing yourself (pretending to be a customer) in a service to understand the experience, provides context for any interviews or participant observations
- **participant approaches** - engaging with participants directly to gather insights, prvides a bigger picture of an organization and service
    - focus groups - asking questions relate to the service to groups of people, good for finding what people agree on
    - in depth interviews - individual interviews that are more intense, good for learning about expectations, attitude, needs, ideas, generally how relevant stakeholders think
    - contextual interview - observing a customer in their environment as they interact with services, products, and organizations. good for keeping interviewees more open and engaged
- **non-participant approaches** - collecting data without actively interacting with the participants. good for counteracting biases introduced when customers are directly asked what they do, which can differ from what they actually do
- **co-creative workshops** - using the knowledge and experiences of a group working together to understand how customers experience services. co-creation is best thought of as a research method for understanding customers, but it is also a way to include customers in ideation 

## interviews

interviews are a research technique that involves asking open ended questions in a conversation that should be informal

### step by step interview guide

1. **define specific research questions** - define exploratory/research questions, the information you will need to be successful, and what sample size you will need
2. **identify interviewees** - define criteria for selecting interviewees base on your research questions, interview customers internal employees, and other stakeholders. use sampling techniques to select a group that accurately represents the population 
3. **plan and prepare** - decide when to conduct the interview, how to start and end it, how long it should be, what the environment should be like. create a semi-structured interview guideline, decide how you will document the interview, ensure interviewees consent to their data being captured and used. consider compensation for the interviewees
4. **conduct interviews** - ask open ended, non-leading questions agree ahead of time on the roles of your interviewer team. in depth interviews usually take 0.5 - 2 hours  
5. **follow up** - review the documented info, write up key learnings, write a short summary, highlight important sections of the interview, properly store all raw data and follow up material

### interviewing skills

- **establish trust** - create safety for interviewees, introduce yourself, make it clear you care about their answers and are here to learn from them
- **use clear language** - ask questions clearly, one at a time, avoid slang, acronyms, and technical terms
- **avoid closed questions** - ask questions that invite more than a yes or no answer, questions should inspire interviewees to elaborate on topics, follow directions the interview goes even if it is unexpected. some example questions:
    - what is it about _ that really matters?
    - help me understand how that made you feel.
    - who else was involved in this story?
    - what is it about the experience that you absolutely loved?
    - tell me what you meant when you said _.
- **avoid leading questions** - avoid questions where you propose a specific assumption/hypothesis which will lead interviewees to a certain answer. these occur when the interviewer has a unnoticed confirmation bias
- **listen** - give interviewees time to think and don't rush them to answer
- **paraphrase** - repeat back what the interviewee said in your own words to confirm you understood correctly, also gives an opportunity for them to elaborate
- **use the five whys** - repeatedly ask why something is (using new questions based on the previous answer) until you can get to the root cause/real reason for something. think of it as recursively opening file folders until you find the file at the end of the file tree 

## synthesis

- **synthesis** - summarizing information in an output that ias easy to share and communicate 

### developing key insights

key insights help summarize and communicate main findings, built on research and supported by raw data

from key insights, you can draw out the actions, needs, and restrictions. with each of these, you can also find the opportunities to think about and explore these in later steps
- **actions** - how are things done, how will things be done?
- **needs** - what do customers require?
- **restrictions** - what obstacles/challenges must be overcome

#### what to consider when creating insights

- wording - insights need to be phrased carefully, concretely, and precisely
- difficulty - don't assume developing key insights is easy, make sure they are build on extensive research and supported by raw data
- feedback - get peer feedback and work with others to make sure the insights are meaningful for your team, and that they are useful as a spring board for later ideation

### jobs to be done

another way to formulate insights, describes what a product helps the customer achieve

JTBD focus on the larger picture of the situational context and motivation compared to key insights

JTBD doesn't consider what products or solutions have existed, currently exist, or might exist. this helps with discovering new solutions

example: instead of stating a goal as "needing to get my floor as clean as possible when I vacuum", state the goal as "maintaining a clean living space". the second goal does not rely on existing solutions, the first goal does

### visualizing research

visualizations help present information and data in an easier to digest format such as images, graphics and charts

#### personas

a persona is a specific fictional person as an archetype exemplifying a group

personas represent a group of people with shared interests, common behaviors, or demographic/geographical similarities

##### creating personas

- create 3-7 personas, enough to be meaningful, but not too many to remember
- some should reflect core users, some should reflect users outside the core group
- make them realistic and have real names. check with multiple groups to ensure the persona does not feel too artificial
- make them use quotes, using real photos to represent personas creates more empathy towards them
- don't create an idealized customer, make suer personas are in touch with real customers and with research data

#### journey mapping

- illustrates the story of a specific actor as a sequence of steps, focuses on human experience. consists of steps and stages that a persona goes through and their experience at each
- create a better idea of the broad picture of a service user's journey
- help us think about the end-to-end experience of a customer including things like onboarding and upgrading
- help us understand how change in one part of the customer journey will affect other parts
- consider:
    - many iterations are need to make a good journey map
    - set the scale: how long does it take to move through the service steps? do you need multiple maps with different levels of detail
    - start with crucial steps and ask what happens before and after
    - going through the process of mapping is more important then the output created
    - journey maps don't have to look good, they can just be used as thinking tools

#### compiling research reports

reports bring together all the information about the research process, methods, research data, data visualizations, and insights in one place
