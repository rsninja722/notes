# discovery and problem framing

"If I had an hour to solve a problem, I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about the solution." - Albert Einstein

your solution is entirely dependent on how you frame the problem. as a scummy example: if workers in a building are complaining about the wait for the elevator being to long, you can frame the problem in different ways. if you frame the problem as "the wait is too long" then your solution might be something about fixing/upgrading the elevators (big cost). if you frame the problem as "the wait is annoying" then you solution might be something like installing music speakers/tv's/hand sanitizer stations to distract the customers and give them something to do while they wait (much lower cost). the course says that "well-framed problems open a solution space to innovative and effective possibilities" in relation to the cheap solution, gives ya an idea of how the people making business decisions think, "don't improve the product, distract people from the problem".

## service design research 

course definition:

- **qualitative Research** - a broad exploration of peopleâ€™s experiences and unmet needs that help to identify problems and come up with better solutions down the road.  
- **quantitative Research** - methods such as surveys and statistics that are used in more detailed design work once problem framing has been completed. 

basically:

- **qualitative** - qualities and aspects that can't easily be converted to statistical data (hockey example: effort put in a game, how well they work in a team)
- **quantitative** - more general data and statics that is more easily compared and expressed (hokey example: how many shot/scores/passes a player makes)

qualitative research is preferred in the beginning of the service design process so it is possible to discover things outside the scope of what you originally intend to look at

### types of research

- **desk research** - 
- **self-ethnographic approaches** - 
- **participant approaches** - 
- **non-participant approaches** - 
- **co-creative workshops** -
