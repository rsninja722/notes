# making change in an organization

knowing the context that a service will be used in (the organization) is important when designing a service. One needs to know how feasible and sustainable solutions will be for an organization.

the solution that would be best for the customer is often times not practical for the business. service designers must have a good understanding of the organization's needs and constraints in order to strike the right balance between what the customer needs and what the organization can sustainably deliver.

an organization's constraints aren't set in stone, good service design can change the internal workings of an organization such as process design, staff training, software, metrics, and even business strategies.

one should be refining your understanding of the organizational context throughout the discovery, ideation, and prototyping stages.
