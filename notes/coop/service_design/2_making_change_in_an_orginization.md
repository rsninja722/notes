# making change in an organization

knowing the context that a service will be used in (the organization) is important when designing a service. One needs to know how feasible and sustainable solutions will be for an organization.

the solution that would be best for the customer is often times not practical for the business. service designers must have a good understanding of the organization's needs and constraints in order to strike the right balance between what the customer needs and what the organization can sustainably deliver.

an organization's constraints aren't set in stone, good service design can change the internal workings of an organization such as process design, staff training, software, metrics, and even business strategies.

one should be refining your understanding of the organizational context throughout the discovery, ideation, and prototyping stages.

## key frameworks and tools

the following are tools used to think about organizational needs and context

### the service design sweet spot

when a solution meets all three criteria, it is in the service design sweet spot
- desirability - meets the customers needs
- feasibility - it can be done at least once
- viability - it can be done sustainably

### business model canvas

used to approach the viability of a service for a business in a structured way

- **value propositions**
    - what is the value you delivery to your customer?
    - which of your customerâ€™s problems are you helping to solve?
    - what is the customer need that your value proposition addresses?
    - what is your promise to your customers?
    - what are the products and services you create for your customers?
- **customer segments** - what groups of customers will either pay, receive or decide on your value proposition? 
- **revenue streams**
    - how do customers reward you for the value you provide to them?
    - what are the different revenue models?
- **channels**
    - how does your value proposition reach your customer? 
    - where can your customer buy or use your products or services?
- **customer relationships**
    - what relationship does each customer segment expect you to establish and maintain?
- **key activities** - what are the activities you perform every day
to create & deliver your value proposition?
- **key resources** - What are the resources you need to create & deliver your value proposition?
- **key partners**
    - who are your most important partners?
    - which key resources do you acquire from partners?
    - which key activities do your partners perform?
- **cost structure** - What are the important costs you make to create & delivery your value proposition?

## organizational factors that make service design difficult

- **organizational walls** - there are often internal "walls" around departments that separate staff into different groups. this can concentrate resources and increase productivity, but makes service design difficult since customers need to move between these groups to use a service

- **organizational logic** - the customers' perspective can be lost when looking through the lens of the organization's logic. what might feel natural to an employee might be foreign to a customer

- **design maturity** - organizations with low design maturity tend to focus on smaller scale things such as tactical/aesthetic design choices (color/position/font of individual components), they also don't think design has enough mandate to influence business decisions. organizations with high design maturity focus more on the overall customer experience and incorporate design into business decisions.

- **change** - most service design projects involve change whether it be organizational, cultural, ect. people have a natural resistance to change
