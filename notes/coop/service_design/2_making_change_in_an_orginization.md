# making change in an organization

knowing the context that a service will be used in (the organization) is important when designing a service. One needs to know how feasible and sustainable solutions will be for an organization.

the solution that would be best for the customer is often times not practical for the business. service designers must have a good understanding of the organization's needs and constraints in order to strike the right balance between what the customer needs and what the organization can sustainably deliver.

an organization's constraints aren't set in stone, good service design can change the internal workings of an organization such as process design, staff training, software, metrics, and even business strategies.

one should be refining your understanding of the organizational context throughout the discovery, ideation, and prototyping stages.

## key frameworks and tools

the following are tools used to think about organizational needs and context

### the service design sweet spot

![sweet spot](./media/service_design_3.png)

when a solution meets all three criteria, it is in the service design sweet spot
- desirability - meets the customers needs
- feasibility - it can be done at least once
- viability - it can be done sustainably

### business model canvas

used to approach the viability of a service for a business in a structured way

- **value propositions**
    - what is the value you delivery to your customer?
    - which of your customer’s problems are you helping to solve?
    - what is the customer need that your value proposition addresses?
    - what is your promise to your customers?
    - what are the products and services you create for your customers?
- **customer segments** - what groups of customers will either pay, receive or decide on your value proposition? 
- **revenue streams**
    - how do customers reward you for the value you provide to them?
    - what are the different revenue models?
- **channels**
    - how does your value proposition reach your customer? 
    - where can your customer buy or use your products or services?
- **customer relationships**
    - what relationship does each customer segment expect you to establish and maintain?
- **key activities** - what are the activities you perform every day
to create & deliver your value proposition?
- **key resources** - What are the resources you need to create & deliver your value proposition?
- **key partners**
    - who are your most important partners?
    - which key resources do you acquire from partners?
    - which key activities do your partners perform?
- **cost structure** - What are the important costs you make to create & delivery your value proposition?

## organizational factors that make service design difficult

- **organizational walls** - there are often internal "walls" around departments that separate staff into different groups. this can concentrate resources and increase productivity, but makes service design difficult since customers need to move between these groups to use a service

- **organizational logic** - the customers' perspective can be lost when looking through the lens of the organization's logic. what might feel natural to an employee might be foreign to a customer

- **design maturity** - organizations with low design maturity tend to focus on smaller scale things such as tactical/aesthetic design choices (color/position/font of individual components), they also don't think design has enough mandate to influence business decisions. organizations with high design maturity focus more on the overall customer experience and incorporate design into business decisions.

- **change** - most service design projects involve change whether it be organizational, cultural, ect. people have a natural resistance to change

## managing change 

analyzing the front and back stage with change in mind helps:
- raise awareness about what needs to change
- answers what people will gain from the change 
- creates ownership over parts of the process for different people
- clarifies the change vision
- builds momentum through short but often successes

### adkar model

the adkar model is based on the understanding that organizational change can only happen when individuals change

what to do durning each step
- **awareness and desire** - gathering holistic research into customers’ and employees lived experiences, building empathy and creates awareness and desire for change
- **knowledge and ability** - co-designing methods, where solutions are designed with stakeholders. Also, prototypes that build knowledge of what needs to change and, because people can see the change in action, how it’s possible
- **reinforcement** - service design moves quickly from ideas to implementation. this lets people see tangible results sooner, which reinforces the value of the changes

## recognizing design maturity

- **people** - is their a dedicated design team? are their people who are in charge of thinking about the experience as a whole?
- **process** - is their a well laid out process that accounts for user research and provides adequate time?
- **budget** - is their a defined and generous enough budget that the design team as some control over?
- **metrics** - are there clear metrics that consider both the business and customer for what a great service experience means?
- **collaborative** - does the design work well together, and work well with outside departments?
- **recognition** - does the company recognize the value of design?


when working and a  **low design maturity** organization
Low maturity — In low-maturity organizations, you’re likely to be given very narrowly focused design tasks, where you know exactly what you’re designing (e.g., screens for a website). Design may not even involve speaking to customers.
- Apply a service design mindset to any customer research opportunities you do have. Your scope for research in low-maturity organizations is typically narrow, but you’ll still be able to ask 2-3 questions that establish more context and give you more holistic insight into the customers' needs.
- Suggestion: have informal coffee chats with people across the organization to better understand their work, and to share customer insights you’ve gained from research.

when working and a  **medium design maturity** organization

Medium maturity — In a medium-maturity organization, you’ll likely have more latitude to understand customers’ unmet needs at a higher level. However, you’re likely to run into resistance when you move into the end-to-end experience, owned by multiple departments or teams. You may also find that “design” consists of a narrow set of activities that need to be completed but aren’t consistently used to inform decision-making.
- Seek out new methods and approaches from books, conferences, etc., and try them out in your work. Write down the lessons you learn and share them with your design colleagues so that you can forge new best practices together.
- Find ways to measure the business impact of your work, even if it's indirect. Communicate the business impact to stakeholders who are not directly involved in the design process.
- When you’re doing service design, gather feedback on how the process works for your colleagues, and use that information to improve your service design practice and to communicate the benefits of service design to others in the organization.
