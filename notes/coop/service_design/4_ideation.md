# ideation

the process of coming up with ideas to address the challenges uncovered during the discovery stage

the goal isn't to create a complete solution, the goal is to create many ideas for solutions that can be vetted, prototyped, and tested


## main stages of ideation

- **pre-ideation** - break down the problem, try to understand the problem at a more fundamental level
- **generating many ideas** - output a broad range of ideas, do not limit yourself, don't focus on the viability or feasibility of ideas yet
- **adding depth and diversity** - take time to review initial ideas and consider them more deeply. try to think of any perspectives or approaches that haven't been considered
- **understanding, clustering, and ranking options** - organize the ideas, use stakeholder input to group ideas around themes/priorities 
- **reducing options** - narrow down the ideas to choose what to further work on and possibly move to prototype

## common ideation techniques

### warm up

a quick warm up should be run before any ideation technique in order to help people in a creative mindset, and open their minds

an example activity - ask people to list as many uses for bricks besides building walls as they can in 3 minutes

### brainstorming

1. create starting points using info from discovery like key insights, provide the knowledge and context behind this info
2. invite a wide range of people - experts, representatives of teams that will be involved, customers, people with no preconceptions, etc.
3. prepare a large enough area where everyone can see the ideas being captured, designate scribes who will write neatly
4. provide participants details of the session and needed contextual information
5. outline Osborn's rules for brainstorming at the start of the session
    - refrain from criticism
    - be open to wild or unusual ideas
    - focus on the number of ideas 
    - build on the ideas of others
6. display the theme/key question in a dedicated place
7. ask participants to call out ideas or answers, ensure everything is captured
8. once all ideas are on display, group them under criteria the group decides on, discuss them, and/or begin a selection technique

brainstorming is best used early on to generate ideas to pursue

*keep in mind*: brainstorming can lead to less diverse ideas since ideas are said out loud or written where everyone can see, people might keep their ideas to themselves fearing judgement. less assertive members of the group aren't as empowered to share their ideas. stop before the flow of ideas slow down too much, but not right as they start to slow down.

#### variations

- have people talk in partners or small groups and then come back to the main group
- have people write ideas and pass the written ideas around
- have people write in groups and then verbally present
- develop ideas while physically interacting with items that might be used, or act as different roles (customer/staff)

### idea mashup

trying to combine items from two different categories, or combine ideas from two themes - one thats related to the problem you are trying to solve, one that isn't

1. take a key insight and frame it as a question
2. decide on two categories to mashup - one related one not
3. ask participants to generate a list of elements and experiences under each category
4. ask participants to match elements from list 1 with list 2 to create a solution to the problem and provide a short definition
5. group ideas under criteria decided by the group, discuss, and/or begin a selection technique

idea mashup us best used at the early stages of ideation and when participants feel like they have run out of ideas

*keep in mind*: encourage participants to share as many ideas as they can in the generating step. make sure you frame they problem well and the group understands before they start

### speedy 8's

getting participants to quickly sketch 8 ideas within 8 minutes, helps prevent people from second guessing their ideas
