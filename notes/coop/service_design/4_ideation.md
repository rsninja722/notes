# ideation

the process of coming up with ideas to address the challenges uncovered during the discovery stage

the goal isn't to create a complete solution, the goal is to create many ideas for solutions that can be vetted, prototyped, and tested

## common ideation techniques

### warm up

a quick warm up should be run before any ideation technique in order to help people in a creative mindset, and open their minds

an example activity - ask people to list as many uses for bricks besides building walls as they can in 3 minutes

### brainstorming

1. create starting points using info from discovery like key insights, provide the knowledge and context behind this info
2. invite a wide range of people - experts, representatives of teams that will be involved, customers, people with no preconceptions, etc.
3. prepare a large enough area where everyone can see the ideas being captured, designate scribes who will write neatly
4. provide participants details of the session and needed contextual information
5. outline Osborn's rules for brainstorming at the start of the session
    - refrain from criticism
    - be open to wild or unusual ideas
    - focus on the number of ideas 
    - build on the ideas of others
6. display the theme/key question in a dedicated place
7. ask participants to call out ideas or answers, ensure everything is captured
8. once all ideas are on display, group them under criteria the group decides on, discuss them, and/or begin a selection technique
