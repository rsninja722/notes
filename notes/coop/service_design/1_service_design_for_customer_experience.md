# service design for customer experience

## intro

service design isn't defined too rigorously, don't expect a 100 page google code style type document that will define the correct choice for every decision. service design provides a general outline for how to go about designing. at a certain point, you'll need to make decisions on your own, using intuition/wisdom gained from experience designing. Service design as a process more so values qualitative data over quantitative data. focusing on qualitative data allows for discoveries outside of what one was intending to focus on, and allows for the plan for solutions and even the definition of problems to shift as new discoveries are made. this is a process that is still being popularized, it has to compete with the traditional process of defining a problem and solution with no room for change beyond reacting to quantitative data that has been chosen to be observed ahead of time.  

## some definitions 

- **Service** - help of some sort, whether this is obtained through a product or a skill
    - services unfold over time and might involve many different touchpoints or interactions
    - example: buying a coffee, uber ride, monthly mealkit
- **touchpoint** - the interactions a customer has with an organization providing services.

## what is service design?

a term coined by Lynn Shostack in 1982, who also developed the service blueprint

an approach to creating services that applies design methods to uncover opportunities and challenges, come up with ideas, and try out possible solutions

it helps develop better services for a business

service design can be broken down in many ways:

### 6 principles of service design

- **human centered** - values the lived experience of all employees, customers, and stakeholders
- **collaborative** - invites all service stakeholders to participate in the design process
- **iterative** - explores multiple options, tests ideas frequently, and changes based on real time feedback/insights
- **integrated** - considers interdependencies, is mindful of how everything will affect each other, even if there is only a single touchpoint
- **pragmatic** - grounds every decision in real world research, tangible prototypes, and measurable business impact
- **holistic** - returns value to te service provider, and pays attention to the people inside the organization

### fundamental aspects of service design

- **Mindset**
    - **open and curious** - not assuming what a solution will be from the outset
    - **generative and creative** - creating space for new ideas and approaches to solving problems 
    - **valuing lived experience** - believing in the inherent knowledge and creativity of all those involved in a service 
- **Process**
    - **research based** - based on real-world observation and research
    - **iterative** - based on cycles of trying and learning, gradually increasing in fidelity and complexity
    - **participatory** - directly involving those who are part of creating a service in the design process
- **Key Tools**
    - **journey map** - a document showing the qualitative experience of a stakeholder moving through the service stages
    - **service blueprint** - a document capturing all the processes, technology, and components of service
    - **service prototype** - an early version of a touchpoint or service that allows the ream to try out ideas and learn by doing

## stages

service design has divides services up into a front stage and back stage

### front stage

focus is on the touch points. example (movie theater): laptop, website, printer, movie theater ticket checker

### back stage

focuses on 
- people affected by the service (employees, customers, third parties)
- props need to create the experience (digital/physical tools, buildings/locations)
- proccess, workflows, and procedures need to deliver the service

## service design models

these are ways to go through the design process while implementing the principles and fundamental aspects of service design

### double diamond

![double diamond](./media/service_design_1.png)

the double diamond has four stages
1. **discovery** - identify the problem, keep an open mind and try to understand the problem, and gather data about the problem and the people affected
2. **definition** - filter and elaborate on gathered data, and define the problem
3. **development** - design solutions to the problem, work with a multidisciplinary team if possible, brainstorm, visualize, and create prototypes
4. **delivery** - test out different solutions at a small scale, reject what doesn't work and improve what does, once a final product is launched, you need to continuously take in user feedback, and improve the product with new versions

### IDEO design thinking

(this is a bit to loose and wishy washy for me personally)

![IDEO](./media/service_design_2.png)

IDEO design thinking is a creative, human centered approach to innovation and problem solving. it focuses on desirability, feasibility, and viability

1. **framing a question** - get your team to think about who you are designing a solution for, and what they actually need
2. **gathering interaction** - gather inspiration from observing people in the world and discovering what they really need
3. **generating ideas** - use the inspiration to brainstorm fresh solutions
4. **making ideas tangible** - build rough prototypes to find out what does and doesn't work
5. **testing to learn** - test prototypes, gather feedback, make changes base on the feedback, and repeat this process until the prototype meets expectations
6. **sharing a story** - once you've arrived at the right solution, create and share the story to introduce solutions to your colleagues, clients, and customers

the process does not have to be followed linearly, steps can be rearranged, and you can jump forwards and backwards to repeat steps

### common elements

- discovery and framing the problem
- ideation and finding ways to address the challenges uncovered in discovery
- prototyping and testing solutions
- implementing the solution â€“ the "what happens next"

## skills service designers need

- **discovery and problem framing** - must be able to uncover the needs of service actors and stakeholders, the following skills are needed:
    - research design    
    - planning and carrying out interviews/surveys
    - analyzing and summarizing research findings
- **making changes in an organization** - any service design project involves communicating to achieve buy-in for change
    - change management
    - stakeholder engagement and communication
    - measurement and communication of data
- **ideation** - bringing multidisciplinary teams together to find solutions to, creating an environment where teams can share ideas, give feedback, and solve problems
    - workshop flow/planning
    - activity design 
    - group facilitation
- **prototyping and testing** - to assess proposed ideas in a low risk manner, you need prototypes to test individual touchpoints and service experiences. depending on what you're making, you could need any of the following:
    - UX/digital design
    - role play/service scripting
    - physical environment prototyping 
    - hardware prototyping (e.g., building models or demo products)
    - software prototyping (e.g., developing wire frames or demos)
    - video prototyping
- **supporting implementation** - once you have a solution, you need to visualize and communicate the change
    - sketching
    - data visualization 
    - presentation layouts
    - active listening
    - storytelling
    - presentation skills/public speaking
    - difficult conversations'/negotiation skills

## what makes a good service?

- delivers value and servers real needs
- flexible - allows us to choose how we interact with it (multiple options for payment/platform/etc.)
- matches our desired timing and pace

### some things that can lead to bad service

- providing more than what the customer wants
- bad communication leading to inaccurate expectations
- lack of flexibility
- in general: not meeting the needs of the customer

## example case: Capitol One

the following is how Capitol One went about designing a money coaching service
