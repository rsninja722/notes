# service design for customer experience

- **Service** - help of some sort, whether this is obtained through a product or a skill
    - services unfold over time and might involve many different touchpoints or interactions
    - example: buying a coffee, uber ride, monthly mealkit
- **touchpoint** - the interactions a customer has with an organization providing services.

## what is service design?

a term coined by Lynn Shostack in 1982, who also developed the service blueprint

an approach to creating services that applies design methods to uncover opportunities and challenges, come up with ideas, and try out possible solutions

it helps develop better services for a business

service design can be broken down in many ways:

### 6 principles of service design

- **human centered** - values the lived experience of all employees, customers, and stakeholders
- **collaborative** - invites all service stakeholders to participate in the design process
- **iterative** - explores multiple options, tests ideas frequently, and changes based on real time feedback/insights
- **integrated** - considers interdependencies, is mindful of how everything will affect each other, even if there is only a single touchpoint
- **pragmatic** - grounds every decision in real world research, tangible prototypes, and measurable business impact
- **holistic** - returns value to te service provider, and pays attention to the people inside the organization

### fundamental aspects of service design

- **Mindset**
    - **open and curious** - not assuming what a solution will be from the outset
    - **generative and creative** - creating space for new ideas and approaches to solving problems 
    - **valuing lived experience** - believing in the inherent knowledge and creativity of all those involved in a service 
- **Process**
    - **research based** - based on real-world observation and research
    - **iterative** - based on cycles of trying and learning, gradually increasing in fidelity and complexity
    - **participatory** - directly involving those who are part of creating a service in the design process
- **Key Tools**
    - **journey map** - a document showing the qualitative experience of a stakeholder moving through the service stages
    - **service blueprint** - a document capturing all the processes, technology, and components of service
    - **service prototype** - an early version of a touchpoint or service that allows the ream to try out ideas and learn by doing

## stages

service design has divides services up into a front stage and back stage

### front stage

focus is on the touch points. example (movie theater): laptop, website, printer, movie theater ticket checker

### back stage

focuses on 
- people affected by the service (employees, customers, third parties)
- props need to create the experience (digital/physical tools, buildings/locations)
- proccess, workflows, and procedures need to deliver the service
