1. In how many ways can 4 different history books, 4 different math books, and 6 different novels be arranged on a shelf if the books of each type must be together?

`(p(4,4)*p(4,4)*p(6,6)) * p(3,3)`

2. If there are 19 students in a class, in how many ways can a professor give out 2 A's, 4 B's, 5 C's, and 8 F's?

`c(19,2)*c(17,4)*c(13,5)*c(8,8)`

3. A group of 15 people is going to form 2 committees, one with 3 members and the other with 6. In how many ways can this be done

- (a)	if the committees must be disjoint?
- (b)	if they can overlap?


- a. `c(15,3)*c(12,6)`
- b. `c(15,3)*c(15,6)`


4. From a group of 6 men and 10 women, a committee consisting of 2 men and 2 women is to be formed. How many different committees are possible if

- (a)	2 of the men refuse to serve together?
- (b)	1 man and 1 woman refuse to serve together?

- a. `(c(6,2)*c(10,2)) - c(4,0)*c(10,2)` all possibilities - disallowed
- b. `(c(6,2)*c(10,2)) - c(5,1)*c(9,1)` all possibilities - disallowed

5. A 2-digit code is obtained as follows. The first digit is a random integer from 0 to 6 (inclusive) and the second digit is a random integer from 0 to 7 (inclusive). Let E be the event that the first digit is even, let F be the event that the second digit is odd, and let G be the event that the product of the two digits is odd. (Note that 0 is even.) Find the number of outcomes in the following events.

- (a)	F ∩ G
- (b)	E ∩ F
- (c)	E ∪ F
- (d)	E ∩ G c

- a. {1,3,5,7} x {1,3,5}
- b. {0,2,4,6} x {1,3,5,7}
- c. E*8+7*F-E*F (everything that satisfies E + everything that satisfies F - (everything that satisfies E and F))
- d. {0,2,4,6} * 8

6. If 29 people are randomly seated in a row with 29 seats, what is the probability that Person A and Person B end up sitting next to each other?

`(28*2) * p(27,27) / p(29,29)` (28 spots that can be sat in side by side * 2 ways for person a and b to sit beside each other * ways for the rest of the people to sit if a and b are beside each other / all possibilities)

7. A 4-digit code is formed by randomly selecting digits from 0 to 9. What is the probability that all of the numbers in the code are different?

`(10*9*8*7)/(10^4)` 

8. (Urn Poker) An urn contains 8 red balls numbered 1 through 8, 8 yellow balls numbered 1 through 8, 8 green balls numbered 1 through 8, and 8 black balls numbered 1 through 8. If 4 balls are randomly selected, find the probability of getting

- (a)	a flush (i.e., all balls the same color).
- (b)	three of a kind. (Three of a kind is 3 balls of one denomination and a fourth ball of a different denomination. e.g., 5,5,5,2)
- (c)	two pairs. (A pair is two balls of the same denomination. e.g., 3,3. Two pairs is something like 3,3,5,5, i.e., a pair of one denomination and a second pair of a different denomination.)

- a. `eq_("(4*",c_(8,4),")/",c_(32,4));`
- b. `eq_("(8*7*",c_(4,3),"*",c_(4,1),")/",c_(32,4));`
- c. `eq_("(",c_(8,2),"*",c_(4,2),"*",c_(4,2),")/",c_(32,4));`
