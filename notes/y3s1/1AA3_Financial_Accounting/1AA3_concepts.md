    - revenues result from ongoing business operations
    - gains result from peripheral operations
- Liabilities are economic obligations to creditors to be paid at some future date by the company
- The primary objective of financial reporting is to provide information useful for making investment and lending decisions

## review

- **horizontal analysis** - year to year percentage changes in line items from comparative financial statements
- when computing trend percentages, the base year is always equal to 100%
- trend analysis (can be done for all statements)
- vertical analysis
- for understated/overstated questions, write out the equations for each year, specifying which is over/understated
- COGS = purchases - purchases returns and allowance - purchase discount + freight-in
- EI = BI + cost of goods purchased - COGS
- different ways of calculating COGS (FIFO, ect.)
- at end of assets useful life - book value = salvage value
- **double declining value: check before answering**
    - calculate ending book value to make sure it is not less than the salvage value
- questions about changes in estimates and disposal(sale) of long-term assets require the calculation of book value
    - disposal of long term assets - calculate the book value at te point of sale
    - change in estimates - calculate the book value a the begging of the year in which estimate have changed
- change in estimation does not change previous years
