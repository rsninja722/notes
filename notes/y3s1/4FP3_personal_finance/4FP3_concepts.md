## hiring a financial planning professional

1. education - B. Com, BBA, MBA ...
2. certification - CFP (certified financial planning), CPA for tax, CFA for investment ...
3. experience
4. reputation

- also consider how much time you want to spend - do you want control, or do you want someone to do everything for you

### how are planners paid?

evaluate advice by being aware of how planners get money

1. salaried employees providing "free" advice - more focused on selling certain products, not necessarily on your personal needs
2. commission planners - gain a cut of the sale if they get you to buy a certain product
3. fee-only planners - paid directly by clients

- certain industries do or do not require disclosure, be aware
