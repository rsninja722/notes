- which best describes when *scarcity* occurs?
    - when *resources* are *insufficient* to satisfy *unlimited* wants
- consider the following economic agents: government, consumers, producers, who in a *centrally planned* economy decide what goods and services will be produced with the scarce resources available in that economy?
    - the government
- in a period of 1 week, M can knit 5 sweaters or bake 240 cookies. In a period of one week T can knit 15 sweaters or bake 480 cookies. which best describes the resource allocation

_ | T | M
---|---|---
S | 15 | 5
C | 480 | 240

- M: 1s = 48c
    - 1/48s = opportunity cost per cookie
- T: 1s = 32c
    - 1/32s = opportunity cost per cookie

M has a comparative advantage for cookies
T has a comparative advantage for sweaters

answer: T has the absolute advantage in producing both, and the comparative advantage in knitting sweaters

- when given production in terms of hours, make a new table with quantities in units

- when its said demand increases, what change has occurred
    - answer: rightward shift of the demand curve
    - shift: entire curve changes
    - movement: move along the existing curve
- fewer families had children, what is the outcome for preschool services
    - demand curve for preschool services shifted inwards
- assume coffee is a substitute for tea, if tea has a bad harvest, what happens to the coffee market?
    - demand for coffee may increase
- $Q^D = 35 - P$, $Q^S = -5 + 3P$ represents demand and supply for bird feeders, what is the equilibrium price and quantity?
    - $35 - P = -5 + 3P \equiv 40 = 3p \equiv 10 = p$, $Q^D = 35 - 10 = 25$, $Q^S = -5 + 3(10) = 25$
- in a perfect competitive market, what happens if demand increases at the same time supply decreases?
    - price equilibrium price rises, equilibrium quantity is ambiguous
- price of W (normal good) have risen steadily, prices for B to store W have dropped and incomes risen, what explains the the rising prices of W
    - demand curve for W has shifted to the right more than the supply curve has shifted to the right
