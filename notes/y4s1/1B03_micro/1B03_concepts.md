## elasticity

- **price elasticity of demand** - $\eta = \frac{\Delta Q / \bar{q}}{\Delta p / \bar{p}}$
    - $\Delta Q$ - change in quantity demanded
    - $\bar{Q}$ - average quantity demanded
    - $\Delta p$ - change in price
    - $\bar{p}$ - average price

- $\eta = 0$ - perfectly inelastic demand - vertical demand curve
- $\eta < 1$ - inelastic demand - some percent change in price results in a smaller percent change in quantity demanded
- $\eta = 1$ - unit demand - price and demand move change at the same rate
- $\eta > 1$ - elastic demand - some percent change in price results in a larger percent change in quantity demanded
- $\eta = \infin$ - perfectly elastic demand - horizontal demand curve, buyers will buy any amount at a given price

- elasticity is non linear, depends on position along curve. for example, changes closer to vertical axis (price) tends towards infinity, closer to horizontal axis (quantity) tends towards zero

### factors

- **availability of substitutes** - products with close substitutes tend to have more elastic demand, narrowly defined products have more elastic demand than broadly defined products
- **importance in consumer's budget** - items that represent a smaller part of a budget tend to have more inelastic demand
- **time period considered** -
