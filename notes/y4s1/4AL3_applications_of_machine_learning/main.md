## exam

- 5 computation questions
- not cumulative

- natural log, dot product, matrices, square root
- regularization
    - l1, l2 most important
    - dropout
    - others maybe important
- NNs - forward but not backwards
    - CNN
    - RNN
    - Transformer
        - self attention
    - be able to do a forward calculation, keep in mind layer sizes
- clustering
    - kameans, heirachical
    - build dendrogram via hierarchical cluster, merge bu finding minimum distance between point sin clusters
- decision trees
    - how do we make
    - bagging and boosting
- reinforcement learning
- high level concepts
    - multimodel architectures
    - natural langauge processing
    - image processing
    - no peticular architecture, just hier level concenpts
        - fusions, embeddings, combining those
        - what happens to text when going into models
- gird world calculations
- entropy, gini impurity
