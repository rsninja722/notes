# thinking critically about mental health and illness

mental health focuses mainly on thoughts, mood, and behavior

we normally imagine metal health as being inside a persons brain/mind. some say it can be traced to biology/personal experience

these approaches miss the way in which mental health is necessarily social in nature

mental health can be impacted by social conditions and climate

mental health is judged in relation to norms (example: bizarre affect - measured against norms)

judgments about if we're behaving in a mentally healthy way is made by others. when getting assessed for a mental illness, you go through a social process where someone interviews you.

markers of mental health (good or bad) are concerned with how we relate to others and with society more broadly 


"Theres all this talk about, high rent prices, high cost of living, droughts, forest fires, flood, war, political polarization, and so on. And there is also an increase in mental health diagnoses, antidepressant prescriptions, and talk about mental health awareness. WTF?"

"if you go see someone about mental health issues because of the state of the world, you get prescribed medication and told to meditate" often we as a society try to address the symptoms instead of the cause of the symptoms.

## what does good mental health mean?

there is no generally accepted definition

broader definitions are more common typically include:

the ability to

- get on with everyday life
- connect with other people
- enjoy oneself
- handle stress, discomfort, and change <- relates to the resources/materials they posses
- pursue goals and interests <- structured by social circumstances

## poor mental health

measures of more mental health also measure against society and social norms

### disorder approach

the disorder/categorical approach:

"has"

assumes mental illnesses exist as  discrete categories

some disorders are almost entirely social (eg. SAD), many other common symptoms rooted in social relationships (eg. paranoia, valorization/vilification, arguments with others)

highly individualized, it assumes disorder are intrinsic. assumes if you put the person on the moon, the disorder is still in their brain somewhere

### distress/dimensional model

assumes:

that every one is experiencing some degree of unpleasant things, but experience them to differing degrees

mental illnesses do not necessarily exist as independent entities rather, all people score somewhere on a continuum of psychological distress

disease is a misnomer

encourages us to think about mental beyond disorders

## the individual and society

if we reject the notion that "mental health" is merely a quality possessed by an individual, how might our ideas about mental health change?

we could think about the "mental health" of systems or networks of people

what might be signs of good societal mental health? social cohesion? productivity? stability? peace? 

### bhutan and gross national happiness

GNH gauges the "spiritual, physical, social, and environmental health of citizens and the natural environment" via national survey

bhutan is one of the poorest and countries and also one of the happiest. They consistently survey their citizens to measure GNH and attempt to make changes to increase it. 

might GNH reveal the ways in which mental health is social in nature?

### poor societal mental health

could societies be "mentally ill?"

indicators might include: lack of cohesion, high rates of fear, paranoia, aggression, crime, etc.

instances of poor societal mental health:

- moral panic? (fear of clowns, fear of satanic cults)
- mass psychogenic event? (dancing plauge)
- deep polarization?
- civil wars?

the idea could be used by people like politicians and those with the ability to enact change on the world to escape responsibility

## the course...

approaches mental health/illness broadly, focusing more on these concepts as broad spectrums of experience, rather than binary states.

asks how mental health as concepts, has come to play such a central role in our lives. what makes this possible? what are the consequences?

explore a tension: are mental health troubles the result of individual problems or broader social issues? should we try to "fix" the individual? can we "fix" society?

investigates why our mental health seems to be getting collectively worse?

# lecture 2

## the rise of mental health

how often are things discussed in reference to mental health?

one of the most powerful concepts of our time. shapes polices and regulations everywhere, even though mental health is loosly defined

what allowed this to come into existance?

from 1800s onwards much of humanty has been wrapped up in urbanization and industrialization <- new phenomenon creating new social problems

there is no evedence of addictions from 150 years ago

people seek solutions/expanations for these new problems, find mental health

- secularization de-emphasized the soul; the mind takes its place 

religion is on the decline

science replaced religion as a conceptual authority. religion used to explain why people would act in ways we didn't want, used to be able to blame the soul, now we blame the mind

new political trends put greater priority for the wellbeing of the everyday citizens

1900s: remarkable and destructive change (WW, colonization, holocaust, partitioning of south asia)

- what are the impacts on people, how would we examine
- how would we prevent these things in the future (after ww2 looked into the pshycology of conflict and war)

WHO (1946) with a new definition of health: not just a lack of desise/injury, instead a more encompasing complete state of physical mental and social state

governments starts thinking of how to prevent mental health problems as a society

concerns are social, responses are largely individual

## the pssy-disciplines and psy-complex

psychiatry and psychology - concerned with "the mental" and how to regulate it. these professions have only grown in size over the last 150 years

- how do we make people better? (problem solving, happiness)

- amount of workers in this field has grown as well as the scope as their work, weighing in on more aspects on life

persistant grief dissorder (scope widening to grief)

psy-complex: tools and knowledge of psy-discepline
- journals, conferences, professional associations, institutions, tools (scales, tests, theraputic modalitys, RX)
- what is "true" within the complex may not be true outside

the epistomelogical world created by ^ is only one way of thinking of the world

knowledge and tools have spread far beyond their psy-professions into many other realms (metal health in schools)

## beyond healing

they argue that the psy-complex is not about healing but enforcing a certain type of social order 

psy disciplines as powerful social actors, setting acceptable limits of behavior and providing techniques/rationale to regulate behaviour


power is not a top down heirarchy in the modern world

power is excersised at the level of  the poputation, we excersize power, often without knowing we are doing so. at the micro level

psy-complex exerts power with its influence, not with the intention of excersizing power

its not an evil conspirency, there is no single entity excerting power, the power is diffuse

- **DSM** - list of mental disorders and their symptoms, constantly changes, reflecting how society changes

the DSM is a tool that disceminates the psy-complex, we think of it as science and therefore as a factual authority

science is a tool used by humans, it is not a force on its own. has immense rhetorical value

medicalization - causing more facets of human existence are coming to be understood through a prisim of the categorical approach

there has been a push for 

this knowledge has filtered down to lay people, tiktokers will learn this information, and present it to the general populus in a lay way

the idea of mental health can be used to condition behavior (a 14 year old on their phone, not a shadow government)

## theraputic tools

lay activities: diet, medication, yoga, exercise, art, music, positive thinking, pets, etc.

assisted individual interventions

psyco therapy

TODO add

thought of not only as tools of healing, but serve as a way to regulate behavior

how can we treat society as a whole?


 
1. defining mental health is complex
2. social in nature
3. how it has become so prominent
4. why do we have a mental health crises in a society of abundance

# lecture 3

# from madness to mental illness

over past 250 years idea has shifted from "madness" to "mental illness" 

madness was a limited term, narrow range of things that would make someone mad

mental illness is more broad, many of thoses with mental illness would not be considered mad

- "illness" suggests something a physician can/should remedy

central questions

- has mental illness been on the rise and why?
- how did mental healthcare become professionalized? (dont think of professionals as always truthful or moral)
- what are the concequences of moving to a very medical apporach

not a story of progress, more so a story of change

be wary of "scientific progress"

## pre institutional history

hard to compare the past to the preset 

all that we can say is that in the distant past, people described behaviours that sound like our mental health problems

hippocrates and galen placed madness in body, yet many contempories saw other expplanations, there was no monopoly on the explanation

wards for the mad existed in the early islamic world, not fully medicalized

medival europe explained: grounded in the body, divine, supernatural, spiritual

- monastary stays, burning at the stake, bloodletting, family care, whipping, etc.

dont overgeneralize, both compasionate and cruel, medical and non-medical repsones existed

- trepidation - drilling a hole in the skull
    - seen all over the world in the past
    - can help if brain is swelling 
    - might have been used to "release demons"?

## bethlem (bedlem) hospital

means chaos, destruction

established in the 14th century, heavy use of restraints

TODO bedlem poem

why did madness come to be feared?


## moralizing madness

TODO moralizing madness: hogarth's 18th century "A Rakes Progress

tom rake loses a bunch of money, and ends up in bedlem

bedlam opened as a tourist site, regarded as a freak show

people would sneak in booze, sexually assault patients

1770 tourism was banned because the crowds could not be controlled

highlights important trends

- stigmatization of mad individuals
- TODO

many justified madness as punishment, said the person invited upon them selves

## vagrancy act 1714

differentiated "pauper (poor) lunatics" from "vagrants, sturdy beggars, rouges"

- charged local authories w/ apprehending individuals who "By lunacy, or otherwise, are furiously mad and dangerous to be permitted to go abroad"
- such inividuals were considered not just bad, but were dangerous to be in public, and should be seperated from society, no punishment or treatment, just confinement

a recognition that the mad were not to blame for their problems

recognition of mad vs other devience

also says the government to try to predict dangerousness of individuals

## rise of private madhouses

new basis for confinement sparked "trade in lunacy"

anyone with property could be payed by the government/privately to store a lunatic

custodial care, not treatment

consequences?

- incentive to keep costs low
- became awful places to be
- concerns over wrongful confinement

## 1774 act for regulating madhouses (60 years later)

- madhouses must be inspected and licensed by royal college of physicians

- now a legal basis for linking medical field with madness, medicalization of madness

gives a legitimacy

- involuntary confinement possible only after a doctor and justice of the peace signed off on it

- state now involved in regulating madness beyond dangerousness

# lecture 4

## enlightenment and modernity

- enlightenment - period of history with bit advances in science/philosophy. also a cultural period
    - reason and rationality
    - transition from religion to science
    - new political philosophies highlighted individualism, liveralism, individual
    - applying reason and science to madness

### tukes and the york retreat

- began to challange the perception of the mad being a lost cause
- the mad were given the freedom to walk the grounds and work the land
- the idea was the if treated with kindness, the mad would respond well
- helped launch the "moral treatment" movement

### moral treatment - philippe pinel

- beleived they were discconected from reason - the highest human virtue
- beleived he could use "theraputic conversation" to improve the reasoning ability of the mad who were not "lost causes"
- believed if treated w/ diginity, kindess and discipline, the patient could recover their reason

### moral treatment - rise of the treatment asylum

- Jean-Etienne Esquirol (early 19th century)
- suggested doctors need special training for treating the mad
- offered classes on "maladies mentales"
- treatment needed to manifest in the architecture of the asylums
    - regiment itself is therapeutic
    - institutions should be placed away from cities
        - thought their was something about urban life was the cause of mental illness/madness

### moral treatment - basic tenets

- kindness and understaning should guid treatment
- patients active role in own treatment
- purpose build asylums
    - calm settings, large grounds, farmland: self suffiecent and help patients
    - architechure was inportant, no bars, bright, airy, rational segregation of patients by gender/disorder
    - prioritiezd discipline and routine through scheduled activities, excersise, etc.
    - restraint to be used sparingly, not to incite terror
    - MD-patient relationship as itself imortant

## asylum building era

19th cetury many massive state institutings, explosion in patient population

- moving away from using as a punishment

- rise in a new profession, the alienist (psyciatrists) (people were alienated from their body)

## legacy of asylums

- "good intentions gone bad"
- moral treatment gave way to custodianship TODO: lookup
- too many patients eventually
- some suggest psychiatry "lost touch" with medicine
- loss of reputation for psychiatry - so few people actively improve, nothing to show compared to other advances (germ theory, surgery)

## huge boom in patient population

### social control - the great confinement

- foucault: rise cause by growing state authoritarianism
    - those how were identified as mentally ill those who did not accept or fit into new political and economic logic of a society built upon rationalism and efficiency
    - people who could not handle 16 hour work days were labeled as mentally ill
    - confined bot for humanitarian or medical reasons but for control
    - emphasis on regiment was for more control of workers

### social control - scull

- scull: asylums as "dumping grounds" for society's unwanted
- psychiatry's upper middle class trying to impose order and control on lower classes
    - using mental illess to justify  trying to correct things they didn't like like sex and drinking
- lumber room thesis - if you build an asylum for the mentally ill, you will fill it or the mentally ill, the asylums weren't in response to anything, but a cause for more mentally ill
    - like modern for profit prisons
    - growing number of patients during 19th and early 20th centurt reflected the widespread labelling of undesirable behavior TODO

### critisisims of social control theory

- romantisizes situation of the mad prior to the enlighenment
- wright: not a conspiracy between the state and psychiatry, but families coping with industrial revolution, the conditions were a problem, but families would go to asylums to cope with the revloution
- the "rise" wasn't about social control, but rather that people were diverted from other institutions TODO

### was there a real rise in insanity

real rates changed on account of the industrial revolution and urbanization

theories:

- dietary changes (gluten and potatoes)?
- alcohol consumptions?
- more toxins (insecticides, latex)?
- more disease (syphilis 3rd stage cause mental illness)?
- mass migration?

dring 18 to 19 century madness transformed into mental illness

# lecture 5 - emergence of the psy-ences

how these declines came to establish themselves as important parts of our world, and how they generate knowledge, and how the knowledge works its way into society

## century of the psyences - 20th century

growth of size scope and importance of the psy-disciplines

in the extreme:

- arrival of "mental illness" expanded to include emotional and moral dimension (compared to madness)
- explaining emotionality/morality in the brain/mind, psy-disciplines freed people from consequence of action and implying their emotional/moral problem is permanent

how they behave/feel is because of things that happen to people - mental illness happens to you, you have a mental illness (durable)

daniel mcnaughten - not in his right mind when attempting murder, should not be held accountable

the range of what people shouldn't be held accountable for widens, frees people from accountability, and also condemns people

doing a personality quiz influences how people think of themselves

- in our culture - understaning, labeling, and reshaping mental processes became seen as central to many endeavours
    - we turn to psy-disciplines to "comprehend and surmount problems of the human conditions like despair, loss, conflict"
        - only in the last 150 years we have turned to science for answers instead of traditional elders, spiritual leaders
    - everyday  concerns like "sex, marriage, womanhood, and manhood; work, ambition, worldly failure, habits, desires, inclinations" are subject to being understood as psychological and potentially pathological
        - when calling something pathological - value judgments 
    - **pop psychology** - from decision making, to habits, to pickup culture.

- people became more concered with mental health as psy-disciplines and knowledge spreads
    - diagnoses shoot up - 20-50% of population likely to recieve a diagnoses at some point
    - other efforts focused on improving/protecting mental health
        - rise in mental health and wellness industries
        - psy knowledge has spread through schools, mass media, social media, police services, government service, etc.
- changes what it means to be human, and how we live our lives
- means that "mental health" being understood as something requiring immediate attention and sometimes drastic action

## freud

dividing figure

proponent of psychoanalysis - a theory and a treatment

TODO

experiences in youth unconcsciously affect our personality and 

- super ego - reflects societies opinions and values
- id - selfishness part of a person motivated by pleasure and aggression, satisfies personal desire
- ego - balances the two

mental health develops when the ego becomes overburdened, often in the youth

psychoanalysis was expensive and intense, change in clientel leading to a chnage of problems

- neuroses emerged

## psychoanalytic movement

psychoanalysis - now disavowed, but many ideas remain, way of thinking stuck

- established the mind was knowable
    - it was thought a psychoanalysis expert could discover anything about a human
- intesified belief that processes of the mind are knowable and changable
    - humans became seen as  calculable and categorizable
- focus on hitherto ignored emotions widened meaning of illness
- now not associated with medicine, asylums, or hospitals
- established the idea that talking can help with problems

## pre ww 2 climate

- marginal within medicines, seen as custodians rather than active healers
- asylums overflowing
- psychoanalysis was popular but faced resistance
    - beyond reach for many
    - brain and biology thought as the key, some practitioners thought psychoanalysis repugnant (antisemitism?)

    TODO

## heroic treatments - fevers, comas, and shocks

- julius wagner-jauregg's malarial  feaver therapy for geneal paresis
    - nobel prize wining
- insulin-coma therapy
- epilepsy and schizophrenia were "mirror image diseases" ladislas von meduna gave schizophrenic patients epileptic seizures through Cardiazol
- cerletti and BIni pioneered ECT to induce seizures as treatmnet
    - only ECT is still used today, though still divisive
    - conditioning through fear?
    - unusual but necesary


## aside

historically:

- psycocis - break from reality
- nerosis - emotional issues

## psyhosurgery (leucotomy, lobotomy)

- Egas Moniz - 1935
    - heard of parts or monkies brains being cut out leading to emotional change
    - developed leucotomy - cutting part of the frontal lobe out
    - claimed results were amazing
    - nobel prize in medicine for leucotomy
- freeman
    - transorbital lobotomy
    - toured hopstpitals to perform lobotomy because it was so renowned
    - lost licence becuse some children died because of it, lobotomys were banned
    - **lobotamobile**

## legacies and controversies of heroic treatment

- how well should we understant an intrevention before it's used?
    - ECT is still not fully understood
- who gets to define success? what does it mean for a treatment to "work"?
    - still a very relavent question. example: increase in ADHD diagnoses

- still able to find people who try to preserve an interest in biological approach

## psychopharmaceutical revolution

- laborit revolutionized mental healthcare with chlorpromazine
    - cheaper, safer, and quicker then heroic treatments
    - at the time called the "chemical lobotomy"
    - first "anti-psychotic" or first "major tranquilizer"
        - phrasing went from targeted to untargeted
    - prompted aother psychoactive drug experimentation, mood elevators, minor tranqualizers, stimulets
    
- prompted theraputic optimisim TODO

"treated illness"

## pharmaceuticalisation

provigil: being tierd isnt the problem, making a drug to keep you up shifts the problem onto the individual, away from society

psy diciplines help translate social problems into individual problems

- huge upswing in use of RX mends to manage ever-widening dimensions of mental health
- yet new treatments often herald new conditions
    - what is normal, abnormal, healthy, sick, safe, dangerous, manageable, ect. is tempered by psychopharmaceuticals
- drugs once used to alleviate "deficits" are shifting towards being used for enchancement, "lifestyle management", ect. even if the language stays the same
    - drugs now being used to push the limist of what is possible for humans
    - widespread epidemic of ADHD? or a personality trait that is attempted to be changed to "enhance" the person
    - when you take a drug and it provokes a change, you think "it fixed my condition", only if you think of it as a condition in the fist place
    - proccess slowly expands as more chemicals can do more

### pathway to pharmaceuticalisation

some theories as to how the rise in pharmaceuticalisation came to be

- immense trust and fait put in sicence from the 1950s onwards (provoked by moon landing, tupperware, ext.)
    - developed belief that science can alliveate all ills whether personal or social
- reassures, pace, and competitiveness of modern life makes quick fixes attractive
- consumerism creates an implicit trust and faith in things we can buy, hold, and consume
    - nothing material to show for community and social support
- "netural" and "objective" clinical expertise is inherently trusted 

## reasons for growth in psy-ences

- scientific advancements, thus justifying  more attention, respect, and power
    - belief that science constantly improves life
- professional expansion?
    - as the professions grew in population, they claimed more legitimacy over ever-increasing domains of human life
    - as a researcher you have to reseach new things, you have to keep expanding the feild of interest/feild of authority
- cultural shift?
    - hyper rationality post-enlightenment?
        - everything can be known, everything is calculable
    - psy-discplines facilitate self-governence by transforming people into calculable, measureable beings, constantly working to ensure our feelings and behaviours stay witin paticualr boundries
    - neoliberalsim promots self responsibilization, society isn't a thing, everything is up to the individual

# experts of the soul 

Joseph Stalin coined the term "engineers of the soul" to refer to writers under his government

psychological expertise has made itself indispensable to modern life in western societies. How should this phenomenon be understood? - in the terms of expertise - a social authority

notion of expertise enables us to distinguish between:
- occupational advancement of a particular professional sector
- spread of a particular mode of thought and technique
- transformation of practices of regulation

seperation between the social concequences of psychology, and psychologists

other fields adopt psycholoigcal ways of thinking because of the justification/guide to action it provides

psychology provides a rational, systematic and simple dealing with unpredictable human conduct

psychology is technical, aiming to producde outcomes of efficiency, reform, education, cure, or virtue

psychology has no institution of its own, grafts onto other professions

tests can be used to look at a person as a number, but also shift judgmnets to the sphere of human truth

ethicalizes power of autorities

provides ethical means of excersizing authority, not an external truth (ex. divine) but a truth that is internal to the person being controlled.

the relation between expert and client is structured by a hierarchy of wisdom


psy-diciplines - psychology, psychiatry, psychoanalysis, and psychotherapies
