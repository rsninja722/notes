# thinking critically about mental health and illness

mental health focuses mainly on thoughts, mood, and behavior

we normally imagine metal health as being inside a persons brain/mind. some say it can be traced to biology/personal experience

these approaches miss the way in which mental health is necessarily social in nature

mental health can be impacted by social conditions and climate

mental health is judged in relation to norms (example: bizarre affect - measured against norms)

judgments about if we're behaving in a mentally healthy way is made by others. when getting assessed for a mental illness, you go through a social process where someone interviews you.

markers of mental health (good or bad) are concerned with how we relate to others and with society more broadly 


"Theres all this talk about, high rent prices, high cost of living, droughts, forest fires, flood, war, political polarization, and so on. And there is also an increase in mental health diagnoses, antidepressant prescriptions, and talk about mental health awareness. WTF?"

"if you go see someone about mental health issues because of the state of the world, you get prescribed medication and told to meditate" often we as a society try to address the symptoms instead of the cause of the symptoms.

## what does good mental health mean?

there is no generally accepted definition

broader definitions are more common typically include:

the ability to

- get on with everyday life
- connect with other people
- enjoy oneself
- handle stress, discomfort, and change <- relates to the resources/materials they posses
- pursue goals and interests <- structured by social circumstances

## poor mental health

measures of more mental health also measure against society and social norms

### disorder approach

the disorder/categorical approach:

"has"

assumes mental illnesses exist as  discrete categories

some disorders are almost entirely social (eg. SAD), many other common symptoms rooted in social relationships (eg. paranoia, valorization/vilification, arguments with others)

highly individualized, it assumes disorder are intrinsic. assumes if you put the person on the moon, the disorder is still in their brain somewhere

### distress/dimensional model

assumes:

that every one is experiencing some degree of unpleasant things, but experience them to differing degrees

mental illnesses do not necessarily exist as independent entities rather, all people score somewhere on a continuum of psychological distress

disease is a misnomer

encourages us to think about mental beyond disorders

## the individual and society

if we reject the notion that "mental health" is merely a quality possessed by an individual, how might our ideas about mental health change?

we could think about the "mental health" of systems or networks of people

what might be signs of good societal mental health? social cohesion? productivity? stability? peace? 

### bhutan and gross national happiness

GNH gauges the "spiritual, physical, social, and environmental health of citizens and the natural environment" via national survey

bhutan is one of the poorest and countries and also one of the happiest. They consistently survey their citizens to measure GNH and attempt to make changes to increase it. 

might GNH reveal the ways in which mental health is social in nature?

### poor societal mental health

could societies be "mentally ill?"

indicators might include: lack of cohesion, high rates of fear, paranoia, aggression, crime, etc.

instances of poor societal mental health:

- moral panic? (fear of clowns, fear of satanic cults)
- mass psychogenic event? (dancing plauge)
- deep polarization?
- civil wars?

the idea could be used by people like politicians and those with the ability to enact change on the world to escape responsibility

## the course...

approaches mental health/illness broadly, focusing more on these concepts as broad spectrums of experience, rather than binary states.

asks how mental health as concepts, has come to play such a central role in our lives. what makes this possible? what are the consequences?

explore a tension: are mental health troubles the result of individual problems or broader social issues? should we try to "fix" the individual? can we "fix" society?

investigates why our mental health seems to be getting collectively worse?

# lecture 2

## the rise of mental health

how often are things discussed in reference to mental health?

one of the most powerful concepts of our time. shapes polices and regulations everywhere, even though mental health is loosely defined

what allowed this to come into existence?

from 1800s onwards much of humanly has been wrapped up in urbanization and industrialization <- new phenomenon creating new social problems

there is no evidence of addictions from 150 years ago

people seek solutions/explanations for these new problems, find mental health

- secularization de-emphasized the soul; the mind takes its place 

religion is on the decline

science replaced religion as a conceptual authority. religion used to explain why people would act in ways we didn't want, used to be able to blame the soul, now we blame the mind

new political trends put greater priority for the wellbeing of the everyday citizens

1900s: remarkable and destructive change (WW, colonization, holocaust, partitioning of south asia)

- what are the impacts on people, how would we examine
- how would we prevent these things in the future (after ww2 looked into the phycology of conflict and war)

WHO (1946) with a new definition of health: not just a lack of disease/injury, instead a more encompassing complete state of physical mental and social state

governments starts thinking of how to prevent mental health problems as a society

concerns are social, responses are largely individual

## the psy-disciplines and psy-complex

psychiatry and psychology - concerned with "the mental" and how to regulate it. these professions have only grown in size over the last 150 years

- how do we make people better? (problem solving, happiness)

- amount of workers in this field has grown as well as the scope as their work, weighing in on more aspects on life

persistent grief disorder (scope widening to grief)

psy-complex: tools and knowledge of psy-discipline
- journals, conferences, professional associations, institutions, tools (scales, tests, therapeutic modality, RX)
- what is "true" within the complex may not be true outside

the epistemological world created by ^ is only one way of thinking of the world

knowledge and tools have spread far beyond their psy-professions into many other realms (metal health in schools)

## beyond healing

they argue that the psy-complex is not about healing but enforcing a certain type of social order 

psy disciplines as powerful social actors, setting acceptable limits of behavior and providing techniques/rationale to regulate behavior


power is not a top down hierarchy in the modern world

power is exercised at the level of  the population, we exercise power, often without knowing we are doing so. at the micro level

psy-complex exerts power with its influence, not with the intention of exercising power

its not an evil conspirency, there is no single entity excerting power, the power is diffuse

- **DSM** - list of mental disorders and their symptoms, constantly changes, reflecting how society changes

the DSM is a tool that disceminates the psy-complex, we think of it as science and therefore as a factual authority

science is a tool used by humans, it is not a force on its own. has immense rhetorical value

medicalization - causing more facets of human existence are coming to be understood through a prisim of the categorical approach

there has been a push for 

this knowledge has filtered down to lay people, tiktokers will learn this information, and present it to the general populus in a lay way

the idea of mental health can be used to condition behavior (a 14 year old on their phone, not a shadow government)

## theraputic tools

lay activities: diet, medication, yoga, exercise, art, music, positive thinking, pets, etc.

assisted individual interventions

psyco therapy

TODO add

thought of not only as tools of healing, but serve as a way to regulate behavior

how can we treat society as a whole?


 
1. defining mental health is complex
2. social in nature
3. how it has become so prominent
4. why do we have a mental health crises in a society of abundance

# lecture 3

# from madness to mental illness

over past 250 years idea has shifted from "madness" to "mental illness" 

madness was a limited term, narrow range of things that would make someone mad

mental illness is more broad, many of thoses with mental illness would not be considered mad

- "illness" suggests something a physician can/should remedy

central questions

- has mental illness been on the rise and why?
- how did mental healthcare become professionalized? (dont think of professionals as always truthful or moral)
- what are the concequences of moving to a very medical apporach

not a story of progress, more so a story of change

be wary of "scientific progress"

## pre institutional history

hard to compare the past to the preset 

all that we can say is that in the distant past, people described behaviours that sound like our mental health problems

hippocrates and galen placed madness in body, yet many contempories saw other expplanations, there was no monopoly on the explanation

wards for the mad existed in the early islamic world, not fully medicalized

medival europe explained: grounded in the body, divine, supernatural, spiritual

- monastary stays, burning at the stake, bloodletting, family care, whipping, etc.

dont overgeneralize, both compasionate and cruel, medical and non-medical repsones existed

- trepidation - drilling a hole in the skull
    - seen all over the world in the past
    - can help if brain is swelling 
    - might have been used to "release demons"?

## bethlem (bedlem) hospital

means chaos, destruction

established in the 14th century, heavy use of restraints

TODO bedlem poem

why did madness come to be feared?


## moralizing madness

TODO moralizing madness: hogarth's 18th century "A Rakes Progress

tom rake loses a bunch of money, and ends up in bedlem

bedlam opened as a tourist site, regarded as a freak show

people would sneak in booze, sexually assault patients

1770 tourism was banned because the crowds could not be controlled

highlights important trends

- stigmatization of mad individuals
- TODO

many justified madness as punishment, said the person invited upon them selves

## vagrancy act 1714

differentiated "pauper (poor) lunatics" from "vagrants, sturdy beggars, rouges"

- charged local authories w/ apprehending individuals who "By lunacy, or otherwise, are furiously mad and dangerous to be permitted to go abroad"
- such inividuals were considered not just bad, but were dangerous to be in public, and should be seperated from society, no punishment or treatment, just confinement

a recognition that the mad were not to blame for their problems

recognition of mad vs other devience

also says the government to try to predict dangerousness of individuals

## rise of private madhouses

new basis for confinement sparked "trade in lunacy"

anyone with property could be payed by the government/privately to store a lunatic

custodial care, not treatment

consequences?

- incentive to keep costs low
- became awful places to be
- concerns over wrongful confinement

## 1774 act for regulating madhouses (60 years later)

- madhouses must be inspected and licensed by royal college of physicians

- now a legal basis for linking medical field with madness, medicalization of madness

gives a legitimacy

- involuntary confinement possible only after a doctor and justice of the peace signed off on it

- state now involved in regulating madness beyond dangerousness

# lecture 4

## enlightenment and modernity

- enlightenment - period of history with bit advances in science/philosophy. also a cultural period
    - reason and rationality
    - transition from religion to science
    - new political philosophies highlighted individualism, liveralism, individual
    - applying reason and science to madness

### tukes and the york retreat

- began to challange the perception of the mad being a lost cause
- the mad were given the freedom to walk the grounds and work the land
- the idea was the if treated with kindness, the mad would respond well
- helped launch the "moral treatment" movement

### moral treatment - philippe pinel

- beleived they were discconected from reason - the highest human virtue
- beleived he could use "theraputic conversation" to improve the reasoning ability of the mad who were not "lost causes"
- believed if treated w/ diginity, kindess and discipline, the patient could recover their reason

### moral treatment - rise of the treatment asylum

- Jean-Etienne Esquirol (early 19th century)
- suggested doctors need special training for treating the mad
- offered classes on "maladies mentales"
- treatment needed to manifest in the architecture of the asylums
    - regiment itself is therapeutic
    - institutions should be placed away from cities
        - thought their was something about urban life was the cause of mental illness/madness

### moral treatment - basic tenets

- kindness and understaning should guid treatment
- patients active role in own treatment
- purpose build asylums
    - calm settings, large grounds, farmland: self suffiecent and help patients
    - architechure was inportant, no bars, bright, airy, rational segregation of patients by gender/disorder
    - prioritiezd discipline and routine through scheduled activities, excersise, etc.
    - restraint to be used sparingly, not to incite terror
    - MD-patient relationship as itself imortant

## asylum building era

19th cetury many massive state institutings, explosion in patient population

- moving away from using as a punishment

- rise in a new profession, the alienist (psyciatrists) (people were alienated from their body)

## legacy of asylums

- "good intentions gone bad"
- moral treatment gave way to custodianship TODO: lookup
- too many patients eventually
- some suggest psychiatry "lost touch" with medicine
- loss of reputation for psychiatry - so few people actively improve, nothing to show compared to other advances (germ theory, surgery)

## huge boom in patient population

### social control - the great confinement

- foucault: rise cause by growing state authoritarianism
    - those how were identified as mentally ill those who did not accept or fit into new political and economic logic of a society built upon rationalism and efficiency
    - people who could not handle 16 hour work days were labeled as mentally ill
    - confined bot for humanitarian or medical reasons but for control
    - emphasis on regiment was for more control of workers

### social control - scull

- scull: asylums as "dumping grounds" for society's unwanted
- psychiatry's upper middle class trying to impose order and control on lower classes
    - using mental illess to justify  trying to correct things they didn't like like sex and drinking
- lumber room thesis - if you build an asylum for the mentally ill, you will fill it or the mentally ill, the asylums weren't in response to anything, but a cause for more mentally ill
    - like modern for profit prisons
    - growing number of patients during 19th and early 20th centurt reflected the widespread labelling of undesirable behavior TODO

### critisisims of social control theory

- romantisizes situation of the mad prior to the enlighenment
- wright: not a conspiracy between the state and psychiatry, but families coping with industrial revolution, the conditions were a problem, but families would go to asylums to cope with the revloution
- the "rise" wasn't about social control, but rather that people were diverted from other institutions TODO

### was there a real rise in insanity

real rates changed on account of the industrial revolution and urbanization

theories:

- dietary changes (gluten and potatoes)?
- alcohol consumptions?
- more toxins (insecticides, latex)?
- more disease (syphilis 3rd stage cause mental illness)?
- mass migration?

dring 18 to 19 century madness transformed into mental illness

# lecture 5 - emergence of the psy-ences

how these declines came to establish themselves as important parts of our world, and how they generate knowledge, and how the knowledge works its way into society

## century of the psyences - 20th century

growth of size scope and importance of the psy-disciplines

in the extreme:

- arrival of "mental illness" expanded to include emotional and moral dimension (compared to madness)
- explaining emotionality/morality in the brain/mind, psy-disciplines freed people from consequence of action and implying their emotional/moral problem is permanent

how they behave/feel is because of things that happen to people - mental illness happens to you, you have a mental illness (durable)

daniel mcnaughten - not in his right mind when attempting murder, should not be held accountable

the range of what people shouldn't be held accountable for widens, frees people from accountability, and also condemns people

doing a personality quiz influences how people think of themselves

- in our culture - understaning, labeling, and reshaping mental processes became seen as central to many endeavours
    - we turn to psy-disciplines to "comprehend and surmount problems of the human conditions like despair, loss, conflict"
        - only in the last 150 years we have turned to science for answers instead of traditional elders, spiritual leaders
    - everyday  concerns like "sex, marriage, womanhood, and manhood; work, ambition, worldly failure, habits, desires, inclinations" are subject to being understood as psychological and potentially pathological
        - when calling something pathological - value judgments 
    - **pop psychology** - from decision making, to habits, to pickup culture.

- people became more concered with mental health as psy-disciplines and knowledge spreads
    - diagnoses shoot up - 20-50% of population likely to recieve a diagnoses at some point
    - other efforts focused on improving/protecting mental health
        - rise in mental health and wellness industries
        - psy knowledge has spread through schools, mass media, social media, police services, government service, etc.
- changes what it means to be human, and how we live our lives
- means that "mental health" being understood as something requiring immediate attention and sometimes drastic action

## freud

dividing figure

proponent of psychoanalysis - a theory and a treatment

TODO

experiences in youth unconcsciously affect our personality and 

- super ego - reflects societies opinions and values
- id - selfishness part of a person motivated by pleasure and aggression, satisfies personal desire
- ego - balances the two

mental health develops when the ego becomes overburdened, often in the youth

psychoanalysis was expensive and intense, change in clientel leading to a chnage of problems

- neuroses emerged

## psychoanalytic movement

psychoanalysis - now disavowed, but many ideas remain, way of thinking stuck

- established the mind was knowable
    - it was thought a psychoanalysis expert could discover anything about a human
- intesified belief that processes of the mind are knowable and changable
    - humans became seen as  calculable and categorizable
- focus on hitherto ignored emotions widened meaning of illness
- now not associated with medicine, asylums, or hospitals
- established the idea that talking can help with problems

## pre ww 2 climate

- marginal within medicines, seen as custodians rather than active healers
- asylums overflowing
- psychoanalysis was popular but faced resistance
    - beyond reach for many
    - brain and biology thought as the key, some practitioners thought psychoanalysis repugnant (antisemitism?)

    TODO

## heroic treatments - fevers, comas, and shocks

- julius wagner-jauregg's malarial  feaver therapy for geneal paresis
    - nobel prize wining
- insulin-coma therapy
- epilepsy and schizophrenia were "mirror image diseases" ladislas von meduna gave schizophrenic patients epileptic seizures through Cardiazol
- cerletti and BIni pioneered ECT to induce seizures as treatmnet
    - only ECT is still used today, though still divisive
    - conditioning through fear?
    - unusual but necesary


## aside

historically:

- psycocis - break from reality
- nerosis - emotional issues

## psyhosurgery (leucotomy, lobotomy)

- Egas Moniz - 1935
    - heard of parts or monkies brains being cut out leading to emotional change
    - developed leucotomy - cutting part of the frontal lobe out
    - claimed results were amazing
    - nobel prize in medicine for leucotomy
- freeman
    - transorbital lobotomy
    - toured hopstpitals to perform lobotomy because it was so renowned
    - lost licence becuse some children died because of it, lobotomys were banned
    - **lobotamobile**

## legacies and controversies of heroic treatment

- how well should we understant an intrevention before it's used?
    - ECT is still not fully understood
- who gets to define success? what does it mean for a treatment to "work"?
    - still a very relavent question. example: increase in ADHD diagnoses

- still able to find people who try to preserve an interest in biological approach

## psychopharmaceutical revolution

- laborit revolutionized mental healthcare with chlorpromazine
    - cheaper, safer, and quicker then heroic treatments
    - at the time called the "chemical lobotomy"
    - first "anti-psychotic" or first "major tranquilizer"
        - phrasing went from targeted to untargeted
    - prompted aother psychoactive drug experimentation, mood elevators, minor tranqualizers, stimulets
    
- prompted theraputic optimisim TODO

"treated illness"

## pharmaceuticalisation

provigil: being tierd isnt the problem, making a drug to keep you up shifts the problem onto the individual, away from society

psy diciplines help translate social problems into individual problems

- huge upswing in use of RX mends to manage ever-widening dimensions of mental health
- yet new treatments often herald new conditions
    - what is normal, abnormal, healthy, sick, safe, dangerous, manageable, ect. is tempered by psychopharmaceuticals
- drugs once used to alleviate "deficits" are shifting towards being used for enchancement, "lifestyle management", ect. even if the language stays the same
    - drugs now being used to push the limist of what is possible for humans
    - widespread epidemic of ADHD? or a personality trait that is attempted to be changed to "enhance" the person
    - when you take a drug and it provokes a change, you think "it fixed my condition", only if you think of it as a condition in the fist place
    - proccess slowly expands as more chemicals can do more

### pathway to pharmaceuticalisation

some theories as to how the rise in pharmaceuticalisation came to be

- immense trust and fait put in sicence from the 1950s onwards (provoked by moon landing, tupperware, ext.)
    - developed belief that science can alliveate all ills whether personal or social
- reassures, pace, and competitiveness of modern life makes quick fixes attractive
- consumerism creates an implicit trust and faith in things we can buy, hold, and consume
    - nothing material to show for community and social support
- "netural" and "objective" clinical expertise is inherently trusted 

## reasons for growth in psy-ences

- scientific advancements, thus justifying  more attention, respect, and power
    - belief that science constantly improves life
- professional expansion?
    - as the professions grew in population, they claimed more legitimacy over ever-increasing domains of human life
    - as a researcher you have to reseach new things, you have to keep expanding the feild of interest/feild of authority
- cultural shift?
    - hyper rationality post-enlightenment?
        - everything can be known, everything is calculable
    - psy-discplines facilitate self-governence by transforming people into calculable, measureable beings, constantly working to ensure our feelings and behaviours stay witin paticualr boundries
    - neoliberalsim promots self responsibilization, society isn't a thing, everything is up to the individual

    TODO define neoliberalism / make ideology note

        states will disinsentivise certain things and interfere with free markets

    TODO lassez-faire

    political and economic philosophy - structures our world now - assumes that the best way to resolve human problems is through the creation of markets (competing forces) competition in markets leads to the best results, for the markets to work the best there should be no regulation/interfearance, government should be small so it does not interfear with natural market forces. there is no such thing as society, we are indepentent individual actors who will maximize our own potential and own good, which will benifit everyone

# experts of the soul 

Joseph Stalin coined the term "engineers of the soul" to refer to writers under his government

psychological expertise has made itself indispensable to modern life in western societies. How should this phenomenon be understood? - in the terms of expertise - a social authority

notion of expertise enables us to distinguish between:
- occupational advancement of a particular professional sector
- spread of a particular mode of thought and technique
- transformation of practices of regulation

seperation between the social concequences of psychology, and psychologists

other fields adopt psycholoigcal ways of thinking because of the justification/guide to action it provides

psychology provides a rational, systematic and simple dealing with unpredictable human conduct

psychology is technical, aiming to producde outcomes of efficiency, reform, education, cure, or virtue

psychology has no institution of its own, grafts onto other professions

tests can be used to look at a person as a number, but also shift judgmnets to the sphere of human truth

ethicalizes power of autorities

provides ethical means of excersizing authority, not an external truth (ex. divine) but a truth that is internal to the person being controlled.

the relation between expert and client is structured by a hierarchy of wisdom


psy-diciplines - psychology, psychiatry, psychoanalysis, and psychotherapies

# lecture 4

## into the $21^{st}$ centry

during 21st centry, psyences continue to entrence in daily life

past 25 years, push in psy diciplines to move away from illness, to focusing on "maximizing human potential"

more overt in their role in pushing people further

governence over psychological life increasingly perfomed by lay people

lay people begin to take a central role, lay people starting to use the terminology without the psydiscipline or science invlovled

medicalization done by lay people

some scholars tie it to the rise in neoliberalism

TODO define positivism

## questions

- how can we explain the emergence of positive psychology?
- how has positive psychology 

TODO

## arival of cognitive behavioral treatment

- roots in early 20th centry behaviourism (watson, pavlov, skinner), itself informed by positivism
    - psychology should adapt the scientific method only focus on things that can be observed and classified (ex. behaviour), not on introspection
    - behaviour is fundementally learned

- mid 20th centry recognized human behaviour is filtered through thoughts
    - ellis: the distress people feel is often not from the event itself, but from the toughts about the event
    - beck: *automatic thoughts* are identifiable and treatable

- by 21st centry, treatment methods emerge with an emphisis on reshaping thoughts, CBT is the leading modality 

## emergence of positive psychology

- as cbt is replacing psychoanalysis, in the 1990's, Seligman had an "epiphany" - his grumpyness arrises from his thought proccess, thoughts arrise first which lead to behaviour
- elected as head of american psychological assotiation said psychology must turn away from "the negative" and from peoples issues, to study the "universal science of happiness"
- Csikszentmihayli - interested in how people that survived WW2 in the face of terrible events could remain optimistic and happy
    - flow - people got into a proccess and could focus on the positives

## key tenets of positive pshycology

- emotions are learned because they come from thoughts, thoughts are also learned
    - inverts freudian theouy that feelings/emotions drive thoughts (themselves product of life experiences)
- positive outlook is good for you, negative is bad, happiness has a looping "multiplier effect"
- positivity can improve all aspects of life
- strive to augment individual's ability to prevent mental illness
    - TODO
    - mental illess can be kept at bay if people thought the right things

- manefesting

## explosion of positive psychology

- started as a movement in an acedemic industry, expanded through media, academia, and professional practice
- clinitions started to integrated positive psychology into their work
- claim that there was a "science" of happiness, optimism is good for virtually all aspects of life
    - "healing effects" - 
        - fredrickson: positivity undoes damaged  that negativity causees to the cardio system
        - segerstrom: positive thoughts boost the immune system
- discorse infiltrates everyday practice
    - gratitude excercises, TODO
- new wellness industry TODO

## mindfulness

- roots of buddhism
- rise due to hippies, simplified for mass consumption
- used by positive psychology as a teachable technique to gaurd against mental health problems, increase life satisfaction, aid learning
- need to be hyper aware of our feelings, always being aware of negative emotions/thoughts
- scolarly critiques
    - reveley: imparts self responsibilization, aligns closely with neoliberalism
    - barker: despite non-medical practice, reinforces dirstress and discomfort as illness which necessitates treatment.

## the happiness turn

- the happiness turn - intellectual and cultural shift
- ahmed: happiness used to be a cinceptual ideal, not an achiveable state, something people worked towards. that vision gave way to the idea that hapiness can be concretely achived, identified and measured, hapiness should always be persued. created a perscription for happiness
- discourse of happiness is everywhere, norms of what is good, desireable, healthy, and prosperous
- not pursuing happiness is a sign that the individual is a failure
- "other" types of hapiness are often not discussed, even looked down upon ("guilty" pleasures)
- ultimately happiness is a choice

## decontextualizing happiness

- many scholarly critiques
- "unviversal truths" about the "science of hapiness" often grounded in culture of individualism
- take hapiness out of the social context, assumptions about hapiness only apply to some with the luxury of their circumstance 

**we have to insolate ourselves against misforture, instead of changing the environment around us**

- positive psychology is a response to and enabler of neoliberalism

## science of positive psychology

critiques:

- perez-alvarez: positive psychology isises the "autority" of science to mask its underlying ideological character
- wilson: mindfulness uses the rhetoric of science to shift expertise from religion/philosophy to the medical realm

stock put in science uncritically, not much stock put in religion

- positive psychology tautologies "those who are more satisfied with there life are more happy" - circular argument

## happiness as imperative

- cabanas: happiness presented as the logical consequece of following the "science" of happiness functions as a set of "ought tos". failing to achive happiness is thought of as a sign of individual malfunction
- held: "tyranny of positive attitude" be happy or face the concequences
    - obscures the "benifits of the negative" (anxiety could be useful if there is something to be anxious about)
- ehrenreich ("smile or die" book)

## further critiques

- assumes how we feel can be measured biologically, and predicted on a universal human being

- critics: wellness industry preys upon insecurites regarding being well, happiness understood as an imperative
- what we assign as "proper" sources of happiness may police certain activities

## conclusion

- by 21st century, psy-disciplines focused on psyche as learned, rooted in cognitive frameworks
    - feelings start as thoughts
- arrival of positive psychology reflects and perpetuates a broader trend wherein human beings imagined as measureable, caterizable
- claims scientific domain over wider array of human feelings, thoughts, and behaviour

# Launching a new movement for mental health

Despite the great attention western countries pay to the mind and human consciousness in philosophy and the arts, disturbances of mental health remain not only neglected but also deeply stigmatised across our societies

western world defineitely trys

the WHO has promised to tackle mental health, but has not provided adequate funding / failed to establish any sustainable systems

responsibility should lie with world bank, country donors, foundations, researh funding bodies, and professional assotiations


## Horton: Launching a New Movement for Mental Health:
- mental health is a neglected aspect of human well-being, intimately connected with many other conditions of global health importance
- resources for mental health are inadequate, insufficient, and inequitably distributed
- there is already a strong evidence base on which to scale up mental health service
- most low-income and middle- income countries currently devote far too few resources to mental health
- there are critical lessons to learn from past successes and failures — for:
    - political leadership and priority setting
    - increasing financial support
    - decentralising mental health services
    - integrating mental health into primary care
    - increasing health workers trained in mental health
    - strengthening public health perspectives in mental health
- any call to action demands a clear set of indicators to measure progress at country level

## clark: medicalization of global health
- mental health issues now make up 13% of the total disease burden
    - 70% of the burden lies in low and middle-income countries
- Movement for Global Mental Health 
    - focuses on treatment gap, aims to scale-up health services and treatment coverage for mental disorders in all countries   
- as mental health is globalising, it brings much needed attention to the issue of mental health, but also creates conditions for disease mongering and medicalization


- **medicalization** - application of a biomedical model that sees health as freedom from disease

- arguments
 - shared biology unifies experiences across cultures
    - counter: disease categories are socially and historically constructed is shown by the fact that homosexuality was a classified mental illness until 198
    - cross-cultural evidence shows how depression in the medicalized fashioning may in others be ‘thinking too much’, ‘fall of heart or mind’, or sadness, or depending on the social circumstances may be distress due to displacement, conflict, injustice, or social suffering
- financial insentive: International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers’ Association highly commended WHO for its leadership and affirmed the pharmaceutical industry’s active engagement in the ‘fight against mental and neurological disorders’ with over 200 compounds said to be in research and development 
-  mental health pharmaceutical market valued in the 10s of billions - hundreds of dollars per person

- research in India suggested, medication treatment may be more acceptable to individuals with common mental health issues than non-pharmaceutical approaches such as talking therapies, especially in a group environment 
- medical labels can be double edged

# lecture

## critiques 3

- summerfield - worked in sub-saharn africa, critical of global mental health unit
    - global mental health won't work, as its based on concepts that aren't meaningful for those being treated in some contries/culturs/communities
    - in some cultures, not talking about things is a strategy to forget and move on from difficult circumstances, so trying to run talk therapy for PTSD, removes agency by telling people "you do have PTSD, and here is what to do about it"
        - not saying that the PTSD doesn't exist, say that trying to enforce a specific treatment could cause more harm than good
    
- jain and jadhav - community mental health services set up across the global south are isolated from the community, and dissconnect TODO

- when a botswonina learned about ADHD, they said "isnt this just describing young boys?"

## critiques 4

- other areas of the world are interpreted as untapped markets
- global mental health movement sometimes frames some mental ilnesss as leading to lower ecenomic productivity

## critiques 5

- **imperialism** - a policy of extending a collective's power and influence through diplomacy or military force

- GMH is a form of psychiatric imperialism
- Kirmayer - global south is effectively prevented from contributing to knowledge production of this "global science"
    - most scientific confreces/journals are in english, and come with costs
    - GMH claims that the science contains universal truths even though it is only developed in northamerica and western eruope
- summerfield - GMH workers should be tought of as the new religous missionaires - modernizing, educating, civilizing
    - the notition of a group "laking mental health literacy" assumes they should think like us, and we don't need to understand their ideas
- others cultures are framed as an "obstacle for understanding"
- not only is a framework for understanding suffering being globalized, the idea of what it means to be a human, and person hood itself is also globalized

## decolonizing mental health unit

those who reject absolutist/universalist approach have pushed against biological-reductionist perspectives

TODO

"ethnopsychiatries"

## conclusions

- global mental health movement aims to atalyze interest and funding for mental health, seeing mental health porblems as a barrier to development and the source of hidden suffering 

TODO

# lecture 6: place, space, and mental health

## recall about mental health

- "mental health" is a more expansive concept than the absence of a diagnosable disorder
    - defined by feeling good and functioning well <- inherently social

## social determinants of health

the factors that are beyond those which are internal and intreinsic to a person.

non-medical factors that influence health outcomes

"conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age ... shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources."

- examples
    - race - to racialization
    - gender
    - culture
    - community
    - access to
        - healthcare
        - education
        - housing
        - food and water

**racialized** - how a social proccess perscribes a person value

## space versus place

space is physical

place is the meaning perscribed to a place 

### example

high score on surveys for poor mental health in a housing estate space that had a negative stigma associated with it, a few years later, the scores were much better - after cleaning up the area and fixing the space

demonstrates that mental halth can be greatly affected by the space and place a person inhabits

## urbanization

TODO

### economic stratification

class impacts mental health

## social causation

### neighborhoods 

urban environment itseft can be a sourcc of poor mental health

- perceived disorder in one's surroundings may increase feelings of pwerlessness and unpreditability, sorce for more substance abouse.
- residents moving in and out offten might limit community and social ties
- TODO

### violence

- amoung the key drivers of poor mental health in urban eznvironments
- 

TODO

### sprawl

suburbinization causes change to peoples' mental health

- some proposed benifits:
    - more greenery
    - less noise
    - closer proximity to nature
- some proposed negatives
    - isolation
    - time spent commuting subtracts from availible time
    - less walking
        - impacts social interection
- suburbs impact urban areas
    - jobs, schools, and stores, move to suburbs, leaving behind urban environment

### housing

spaces also matter

- upper floors of high rises are associated with greater neruotiscism and social isolation
- poorer housing associated with greater social stigma/negative evaluation
- TODO

### homelesness and homefulness

- having a home or not signigicly 

TODO

# nature

# greenspace

- can be mitigated if parts are considerd dangourus 

## conclusuions

we can think of mental health as if people have something or not, or a variable that all people have that relates to a sense of ontrol, feeling of belonging, social connection, and having purpose in one's life

social determinants have tremendous importance in shaping mental health outcomes

its not that things that intrinsic to the person don't matter, its that only focusing on that is a limited way of thinking

# gender, sexuality, and mental health

## key questions
- do men and women experience similar rates of mental pathology
    - is mental illness  TODO
- how might distress be genderd
- TODO

## hysteria

one of the most studied issues

thought to be age old, with ever changing symptomology including:
- fits
- losing ability to use limbs
- angry, iritable
- exusted
- losing ability to see
- highly emoitional

- micale: a dramatic metaphor for everything that men found mysterious TODO

in ancient world:

the womb was blamed "a roming uterus"

- indicative of tendency to somatize womens mental health TODO - define
- gender norms (and violation) thought to be linked to mental health

medeval/early modern times:

- explanations sometimes centered on witchcraft and demons

post industrial revolution

- exmplained hysteria as a consequence of women's constitutional weakness
- shifting symptomology reflected "unpredictable nature" of women's bodies
- common treatment for hystareia - "hysterical paroxysms" (orgasms through vibration, vibrators originally marketed as a health treatment)

20th centry

- freud and others reimagined hysteria along psychological lines

- term "hysteria" replaced by "conversion disorder"

### uses of hysteria

- imagined symptoms and causes reflect shifting ideas about gender, including the behaviours "appropriate" for women
- both "pathologized and protected" women - by pathologizing, frames as something beyond one's control - freeing from some responsability (pathologize - frame as illness)

- symptoms be understood as a form of resistance against gender norms (suffragettes, educated women)
- could be seen as a medicalization of a male defensive response to femal assertiveness
- a (subconscious) strategy for the powerless? example: hysterical leg paralysis (thought of as a protest or resistance of whats expected because of the lack of power)

hysteria as evidence of
- how biological difference can be weponized to explain mental health problems 
- how expressions of distress themselves can be gendered
- how gender norms structure understnadings of mental illness (example: bipolar personality dissorder)

## symptom repertoire

set of recognizeable determinates for a condition

## abuse of psychology for political means

those who spoke out against the state were diagnosed - their ideas were labeled 

## gender and mental health imbalances

- intopunitive 
    - shame
    - doupt
    - anxiety

- "intopunitive" emotions self-reported more often by women
    - diagnosed more often with axiety, depression, EDs, some PDs
- "externalizers" (anger, aggression) self reported by men
    - diagnosed more often with substance-use disorders, anti-social behavioural disorders

competing explanations
- real differences based on physiology
- real differences based on social conditions and socialization
- false differences based on research/diagnosic bias (men more likely to volenteer for experiments for medication, women more likely to put themselves forward for mental health diagnoses, men represented more in the justice system)

## sources of stress

- women tend to self-identify as having mental health problems more commonly, also diagnosed at a higher rate
- is this related to distress? if women experience more distress why? proposed explanations:
    - exposure to harm
    - fewer resources (purchasing power - women concentrated in service industry (insurance differences), bad parental leave compensation)
    - dual burden (carer and house work)
    - "female roles" - more stifling, less socially rewarding
- case study: "supermoms"
    - "intensive mother ideologies" linked to negative effects on mental health
        - increased stress, anxiety, guildt, decresed sense of self-efficacy
    - effects found in "supermoms" and those in their social circles

## gender and anorexia

women diagnoesd at a rate 7-10x that of men

possible explanations
- differing standard of beauty for men and women
    - slimness for women
    - muscularity for men
- women socialized into giving up control - especially to families. "well behaved" women seeking control
    - anorexia is a form of rebelion and attempt at control over own life
    - idea divides feminist theorists: some support, some reject bevause it values "male personality traits" as ideal: autonomy, independence, emotional distance
- Bordo (post-structural fenitist): a form of resistance to maternal body and the "suffocation destiny of reproductive motherhood"

## suicide

common finding: women attept suicide more frequently, men are more likely to complete suicide more frequently

possible explanations
- higher rates of testoterone/aggression lead to more lethal attempts (different methods for attempts)
- men socialized into traits like decisiveness, not failing, not giving up - masculine gender norms leads to making completed suicide more likely
    - men more to have access to more effective menthods (example: guns)
- womens preferred methods reflect a gendered expectation to preserve beauty

previous examples predicated on belief real differences exist in the mental health problems experienced by women and men

## resons for differences

### expressing mental disorder

theory: experience does not differ, counting differs (due to different expressions of symptoms)

suggestion: male and female variants of depression, only female variant easily recognizable

- "female depression" - internalizing behaviours/feelings, somatic symptoms
- "male depression" - exhaustion, irritability, restlessness, substance use

hard to debate since there is no way to know if someone is depressed

### reporting

suggestions:
- women report mental health concerns to doctors more often
- men less likely to report mental health due to socialization ("feminine")
    - favour "non-mental health words" example: "burnout" vs. "depression"
- differences not solely related to gender. some ment more likely to report, example: more educated, have intimate partner, chronic illness and disability

### diagnostics and treatment

shifts responsibility away from the people being diagnosed onto the researchers/doctors

suggestions:
- research/diagnostic bias
- with non-immediately observable complaints, MDs tend to assume men's problems are organtic, women's problems are psychosomatic
- women less likely to receive advanced diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, more likely to receive medical prescription

## case study: femal sexual dysfunction

- some scholars point to mental disorders related femal sexal dysfunction as evidence of clinical and research bias

- female orgasmic disorder
    - from the DSM: "any difficulty or delay in reaching orgasm that causes the women personal distress." can we separate distress TODO
    - diagnosable if a women doesn't orgasm from "sufficient stimulation"
- sexual interest/arousal disorder
    - US data: 32% of women "have it", more than 2x the rate of men
    - symptoms include "discrepancies in desire" and being "typically unreceptive to a partner's attemos to initiate

- for scholors, these disorders and their criteria heavily reflective of traditional medical (male) gaze

gendered ideas built into the diagnostic tools

## queer mental health

sexualities and gender identies TODO

- homosexuality delisted from the DSM in 1980, replaced with "ego-dystonic sexuality" (distress over being having same-sex attraction) until mid 1980s
- queer individuals appear to be at greater risk for poor mental health
    - TODO

### sources of distress

theories on sources of additional distress:
- predjudice, social exclusion, coming out process, internalized stigma, heteronomativity
- siginificantly elevated reates of physical and sexual assult
- could this be about broader social determinats 
    - example: in ontario, >50% of trans individuals live on <$15k, much more likely to experience homelessness
- discrimination within the healthcare system itself

### when care causes distress

- case study: gender identity disorder, first appeared in DSM III
    - DSM IV: boys who want to wear dresses, girls who refues to wear them...
    - boys roughly 6x more likely than girls to be diagnosed with GID
    - conversion therapy applied to restore "normal gender identiy"
- DSM 5: terminology shifted to gender dysphoria

TODO

## conclusions

- mental health differeces between sexes and genders complex, related to social determinates, medical assumptions, and perhaps physiological differences
- throughout recent history, transgressing gender and sexual norms identifie both as "proff" of mental disorder, as well as cause of distress







# meg john barker: depression and/or oppression? bisexuality and mental health

bisexual people are more prone to mental health problems then other queer or straight people

popular understandings of mental health are binary and internal
Either
I’m ill—I need help—it’s not my fault
Or
I’m not ill—I don’t get help—it is my fault

understanding of distress
- ill - biological, not personally accountable
- not ill - caused by bad habits or personal deficiencies, personal responsible, cure is strenghtening willpower

due to cultural tendancies and neoliberal thinking

reflected in self help industy with "victimization" self help and "enpowerment" self help

Binaries put people in unhelpful double binds that exacerbate distress - **accepting one side inevitebly involves denying the other**

accepting one side also leaves one haunted with the possibility of the other side - need to constantly prove illness or wellness

the two options are 
1. you need fixing - disempowerd
2. you are to blame for your problems - guilty if reaching out for help
s
either way distress is internalized as the proposed causes are both internal

biopsychosocial - mental health is a matter of one's existing biology and neural connetions, and influences of what is learned during growth

problems with binary view:

1. It forces people into trapped either/or positions which separates out ‘us’ and ‘them’ when, in fact, we all suffer over the course of our lives.
2. It oversimplifies the reasons for distress despite the major problems in locating emotional experience solely within atomized individuals.
3. It internalizes what are often highly social forms of suffering in ways which exacerbate distress.

## bisexuality in mental health

marginalization is harmful for bisexual people - not having a place in a binary is harmful to mental health

"bicurious" used as a way to dismiss bisexuallity (just a phase)

to those unfamilier with bisexuality, bisexual people appear to meet the criteria for BPD 

within the lgbtq community, there is often a focus only on the lg
