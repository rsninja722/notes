# race, ethnicity, and mental health

## race as a construct

- race is tied to a few phenotypic traits (skin pigment, eye shape), it doesn't exist in any sort of biologically essential and - meaningful sense.
    - we chose specific things to divide up race, could draw on something else like blood type
    - no such thing as a pure race, nor "pure" people
    - we crate these divisions, our understanding of race is different across time

- despite constructed nature , race is still meaningful
    - even though it is just a construct, it has social power
    - we are placed into racial categories, or read as different races
    - constructed in a relational sense (think hierarchical)
    - because of racialization, there may nonetheless be cultural differences formed by differential social experiences

- peoples' experience of race can shape culture
    - because of this, some people map culture onto biology - racism

## race and mental health

- psy-disciplines typically approach mental health as treating individuals (individualism, reductionism (example: focus only on the brain))

- psy-disciplines are assumed to be universal despite being born of a specific cultural environment 
    - cristopher and hickinbottom - there is no such thing as a value-neutral, culture-free psychology
    - the things the psy-disciplines are interested in cannot be measured TODO

- well being might not be just about how they feel, but about how their family or community functions

## samuel cartwright, psy-ences, and slavery

from the american south in the 1800s

he defined:

- drapetomania
    - slaves who ran away from their slave owners should be understood as a desises of the mind that was curable (giving better food clothing, and limiting social interactions)
- dysaethesia aethiopica
    - TODO

- one of many people who helped reinforced the conditions for slavery

## colonialism and the psy-ences

- complicit in helping to propagate colonialism in africa into 1960s
    - not an artifact of the 1800s/1900s, but something that continued well into the 20th century

- the "limit of the african mind"
    - reflected psy-ences's understanding of race as a natural essential, biological category
    - lots of research turned up findings that reinforced colonialism by "demonstrating" lower intelligence, limited capacity for growth, and submissiveness of different races

- psy-disciplines were often employed in disciplining those who posed a challenge to colonial order
    - striking miners were prone to being "psyciatrized"


## the psy-ences and canadian colonialism

- helped perpetuate the idea of the "nobel savage" - primitive, wild, uncorrupted by civilization
    - they encountered "civilization" and went mad
    - asylum records reveal indigenous individuals institutionalized for things that looked like resistance to colonization, interpreted as madness "arctic hysteria"
        - culture bound syndromes in DSM 4, "arctic hysteria" until 2013 - exists in inuate populations - speaking in toungs, running away
    - resistance to the colonization was seen as a mental health problem
    - within institutions, indigenous patients sterilized under eugenics laws at substantially higher rates, e.g. leilani muir
    - medicine had a responsibility to "improve" the human race through sterilization
    - the modern "suicide crisis" seen as a mental health concern, issue is individualized by claims that their are insufficient mental health resources, ignores all other conditions that come with the area they lived in

## the "protest psychosis"

- metzl: until early 1960s, schizophrenia primarily diagnosed in petty criminals, non-violent white people, including "women from rural michigan"
    - by 1970s, synonymous with "masculinized black belligerence" - during civil rights movement
    - racial anxieties of practitioners lead to different readings of people
    - some psychiatrists suggested that the feelings inspired by black power movement were symptoms of psychosis

# race and psy-world, case study

- in comparison to other racial ethnic groups, black people are institutionalized at a disproportionate rate
    - in british psych hospitals, black individuals make up 21% if the patient population, but only 7% of general population, echoed in north america
    - conduct disorder and schizophrenia more likely, depression less likely
    - less likely to be referred for psychotherapy

## how can we explain these differences in health care

posibilities:

### real differences in mental health

- levels of psychopathology really higher perhaps due to issues like migration and poverty
- the experience of racism itself may be a driver of mental health problems
    - feeling of always being in danger
    - may impact sense of well-being, self-esteem, self-confidence, overall stress
    - example from new york: "stop-and-frisk" policing and mental health study
        - black men had more mental health problems in areas where stop-and-frisk policing occurred

### socio-cultural disconnect

- differences due primarily to a cultural disconnect (largely white) practitioners and black patients
    - diagnoses not because of more distress, but because the knowledge employed in treating is rooted in a different culture
    - study of canadian caribbean population
        - jamacian psychiatrist and white psychiatrists, white psychiatrist diagnosed more people with schizophrenia, the jamacian psychiatrist explained the cases as a normal cultural belief

- forming used more often because black individuals often referred by police services, rather than medical services. why?
    - overpolicing
    - barriers to accessing medial services, both economically, and culturally
    - greater mistrust of official services may increase towards voluntary care

- forming - forceful detainment in psych hospitals

### racism and psychiatry "speak the same language"

schizophrenia as an example

- the same way blackness is framed as "otherness" or a deviation from the "norm", schizophrenia is seen the same way
    - both have the effect of dehumanizing the individual, focusing on imagined or assumed biological criteria
- in the way we essentialize race, we also do with mental illness
- TODO
- blackness and schizophrenia sometimes (unfairly) associated with "dangerousness"
- TODO

### others

- when we speak about psychiatry, it identifies as a science, as a society, we imagine it as anetrual and objective excersise, free from bias. but science is practiced in a social context
- frenando - a psych assessment is a meeting between two people, one with lots of power, one without. the practitioner has to make a moral judgement where "bad" thoughts or "incorrect" responses become the basis for making judgement on sanity
    - if racism exists outside the clinical encounter, it may exist within it as well
    - the psychiatrist is not judging the state of the organs, but rather its products - values, beliefs, thoughts - themselves socially mediated

### psychiatrization

- psychiatrization - the way in which we understand problems solely through psychiatry

- mcgibbon - oppression can produce anxiety, frustration, ect. yet psychiatrization means that we read these mental health impacts as individual in nature, rather than political
    - psychiatrization encourages use to think of mental health problems as apolitical, devoid of social context
- example: intergenerational trauma - conceptualized as a mental health problem in individuals instead of a community problem
    - by labeling social and community disruptions as an individual's mental health problems, it is harmful to those communities TODO

## simplification

- the way race interacts with mental health is not always straightforward
- we know that there is a greater burden of mental health problems among marginalized people
    - logical conclusion? TODO
- yet some studies show poor black women experience the best overall rates of mental health even if disproportionately represented in some categories

### cultural schemas

- rosenfield - cultural schemas may explain the paradox
    - "self-salience" beliefs about the relative importance of the self in social relations
    - under privileging the self leads to internalized issues, over-privileging leads to externalizing problems 
    - argues self-salience is at neither extreme within african american culture - leads to less internalizing or externalizing mental health problems

basically - its complicated, don't overgeneralize

## conclusions

- the psy-disciplines have historically struggled with issues related to race and culture
- cultural values and norms are central to the process of psychological care
- racial disparities permeate the world of mental health
- class so often intersects with race that it can be difficult to speak solely to issues of race
- avoid over simplifying

# mental health across the lifespan

## introduction

- when we define good mental health - it is centered from or drawn from the norms of middle-aged adults, what are the implications for children?
- recently, there have been intensified concern over mental health in children, why?
- some unique challenges such as 3rd party reporting - when someone is assessing a child's mental health, they might go to a parent or teacher
- how do we reconcile understanding of mental health challenges as chronic with dynamic changes associated with growing up?

## emergence of childhood mental health

- "childhood" is an invention from the 19th century, and "teenager" is an invention from the 20th century
    - relatively new conception, used to be thought more of as small adults
    - children used to start working and apprenticing early on, also starting families earlier
- sparked new interest from psy-ences about nature and conditions of "proper development" (stages of childhood development)
    - once norms are developed, you can measure against the norms
- children were conceptualized, "bad kids" -> "problem children" -> "mentally ill children"
- psychoanalysis increased interest in family dynamics
    - interested in a children's relationship with their parents
- 1950s cult of the "ideal family" made the idea of the "broken home" a threat
    - single  mothers, divorcees, and widowers all cited as incubators of poor mental health

## mental health in the school system

- with belief that children could have unique mental health issues, mental hygiene movement promoted prevention
- schools - key site where children are evaluated - an extension of the state to create certain types of institutions
    - 1960s moves to identify "pre-delinquent" children
        - guidance councilors created due to increasing concerns about childhood mental health
        - new training for teachers
        - big increase in the amount of kids identified as having mental health problems
    - distinction between "healthy" and "unhealthy" children hardened, as medicalized, binary approach displaced spectrum/continuum
        - newly created forms of mental illness began to capture these "disturbed" children
        - hyperactivity is something some kids have, and others did not instead of all kids being hyperactive to some degree

## case study: conduct disorder

- DSM: "a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age appropriate societal norms or rules are violated"
- signs: fighting, bullying, cruelty to animals, destructiveness to property, fire setting, stealing, lying, truancy, running away, temper tantrums, playing pranks, ignoring curfew, disobedience
    - moral/legal issues
    - "age appropriateness" - truancy or curfews
    - all context dependent
- really wide symptomatology of US pediatric population
- are such disorders meaningful or mearly ways to identify and act upon children whose behavior contravenes social norms and/or rules

## impact of childhood diagnosis

- being diagnosed is not inconsequential, what does it mean to be diagnosed?
    - access to care, accommodations, and benefits
    - impacts identity and self-concept (could be legitimizing)
    - changes how others treat the person
    - some degree of disempowerment
    - changes how parents are perceived
        - children with autism and schizophrenia lead to people thinking the parents were to cold or inconsistent in raising their child
    - may result in treatment (behavioral, stimulants)
        - stimulant prescription increased more than 700% since 1990

## explosion of childhood mental illness

- consequent explosion in diagnostic rates
- since mind 1990s:
    - rates in ADHD up by > 300%
    - autism diagnoses up by 2000%
    - childhood bipolar disorder rates increased by 4000%
- 30-40% of kids in ontario schools are diagnosed with some mental illness
- childhood redefined as critical period for mental health intervention (sense of urgency)
    - biological explanation: neural plasticity, connections being forged within brain at this time
    - psychological explanation: learned behaviours, patterbs, self-concept formed during childhood
    - social explanations: childhood is when people learn relation TODO

## the rise - changes to diagnostic criteria

- expanding symptom criteria
    - for ADHD, inattentiveness was added as a criteria. 
    - autism's shift to a spectrum - lowered the threshold for a diagnoses
    - since Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) introduced in DSM-III, criteria loosened so greater number of behaviors understood as symptoms
- "childification" wherein new "childhood symptoms" created for disorders associated with adults
    - example differences in "mood swing" for bipolar disorder in adults versus children
    - for children practitioners look for mood swings on a daily scale instead of the normal weekly scale 
- new diagnoses (example: DMDD - Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder)

## the rise - family and parenting change

- some argue that parents are busier and stretched (because of stress and competitiveness of neoliberal economies), thus less tolerant of children's behavior
- combines with changes to family structure
- children aren't more mentally ill, we are more likely to label them as such because it transfers responsibility from the parent to the child/makes parenting easier - parents are responding to social issues and just don't have time
- moving from family/community support/advice to reliance on professional parenting advice has elevated anxieties over "imperfect" children, decreases acceptance of children
- shifts in parenting styles (from authoritarian to child-first orientations) may inhibit protective mental health qualities
- parents either 
    - TODO

## the rise - third party reporters

- symptom reporting not necessarily from the child, parents/teachers more likely to pursue a diagnoses
    - many disorders tend to be diagnosed when a child begins school
    - some argues that school officials more likely to identify the child as having mental health problems when mehavioural issues making theaching difficult
        - especially true if staff is overburdend
        - diagnostic categories are created then make way into medical use, then make their way into everyday use
    - specialist teachers found to be more tolerant and less likely to report behavior as mentally unhealthy than general class teachers
    - parents more likely than physicians to identify behavior as meeting criteria for DMDD
- again, intersection of socio-economic challenges may have a bearing on TODO

## the rise - other explanations

- awareness and/or "diagnostic culture"
    - our culture has changed so the way we interpret the world through a diagnostic lens
    - lobby groups (CHAAD, Pharma) actively promote the notion that mental health problems among children are widespread
    - more corollary materials teach parents to look for and identify the symptoms of mental health problems
    - "TikTokification" of diagnostic criteria
        - from 100 ADHD TikToks, over 250 different criteria given
- others highlight social changes that might make children more mentally ill (rather than more likely to be labelled as javing a mental health problem)
    - climate change anxiety
    - increased expectations and stress
        - higher job standards
    - technology access
        - social media
        - attention spans
        - constant negative information
    - dietary changes
    - less exercise

## conclusions

- child hood mental health has become an area of significant concern
- diagnostic rates for most mental health problems related to children have increased significantly and steadily over recent decades
- some children as challenges to overworked, overstressed individuals "responsible" for their wellbeing
- boom in childhood mental health problems should not be understood as changes in children them selves, they are targets of intervention due to social changes
- TODO

# strikes

strikes necessarily cause disruptions

the goal of the labor side is to cause disruption
the goal of the employer is to end the strike

strikes are a PR battle, and all about communication

charter of rights and freedoms guarantees the right to strike, the notwithstanding clause meant for quebec language can be used to charge strikers financially 

public sector workers in ontario have had wages frozen at a max of 1% increase a year

the results of strikes create precedents for future labor rights (affecting you)

since 2018, mcmaster made a $730 million surplus

mcmaster offered $40000 to be divided among TAs

picket line pay is $14 an hour for 20 hours a week





# institutions

- psychiatric hospital
- hospitals with psych units 
- residential care facilities
    - still people living their
    - more community based
    - stepping stone back to independent living
    - look like houses
- forensic psychiatric facilities
    - combination of prison and medical system
    - for people convicted of crimes but deemed mentally ill

## total institution

people have to accept the norms the institutions place upon them, resistance against the institution is reframed as justification of mental illness or inability to care for self, many people admit they fake everything just to get out of institutions

- institutional neuroses - the structure and regiment that people are conditioned to in an institution is so disconnected from the real world that institution could be doing more harm then good. the structure of an institutions has an effect on people 

- deinstitutionalization - 
    - when there is a lack of community support, and decrease of institutions, people with mental health problems still need to go somewhere
    - transinstitutionalization - with the absence of institutions, people end up in the justice system








# sami tamimi - mcdonaldalization of childhood

- diagnosis and prescription for childhood mental disorders has increased in the past few decades in post industrial countries
    - some explain this as science progressing and recognizing conditions that were always there - de-politicized view
        - post industrial countries
        - increased schooling
        - change in family structure
        - increased technology use
        - narcissism
    - some explain this as a real increase in emotional and behavioral problems that lead professionals to try to understand and alleviate the problem
        - classroom setting, disruption is seen as mental illness
        - more adhd
    - some explain this as their being no real increase in emotional and behavioral problems, just a shift in how we classify and deal with children's behaviors
    - some explain this as an interaction between a increase in emotional and behavioral problems, and how adults classify and deal with it
