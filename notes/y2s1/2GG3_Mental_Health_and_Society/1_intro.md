# thinking critically about mental health and illness

mental health focuses mainly on thoughts, mood, and behavior

we normally imagine metal health as being inside a persons brain/mind. some say it can be traced to biology/personal experience

these approaches miss the way in which mental health is necessarily social in nature

mental health can be impacted by social conditions and climate

mental health is judged in relation to norms (example: bizarre affect - measured against norms)

judgments about if we're behaving in a mentally healthy way is made by others. when getting assessed for a mental illness, you go through a social process where someone interviews you.

markers of mental health (good or bad) are concerned with how we relate to others and with society more broadly 


"Theres all this talk about, high rent prices, high cost of living, droughts, forest fires, flood, war, political polarization, and so on. And there is also an increase in mental health diagnoses, antidepressant prescriptions, and talk about mental health awareness. WTF?"

"if you go see someone about mental health issues because of the state of the world, you get prescribed medication and told to meditate" often we as a society try to address the symptoms instead of the cause of the symptoms.

## what does good mental health mean?

there is no generally accepted definition

broader definitions are more common typically include:

the ability to

- get on with everyday life
- connect with other people
- enjoy oneself
- handle stress, discomfort, and change <- relates to the resources/materials they posses
- pursue goals and interests <- structured by social circumstances

## poor mental health

measures of more mental health also measure against society and social norms

### disorder approach

the disorder/categorical approach:

"has"

assumes mental illnesses exist as  discrete categories

some disorders are almost entirely social (eg. SAD), many other common symptoms rooted in social relationships (eg. paranoia, valorization/vilification, arguments with others)

highly individualized, it assumes disorder are intrinsic. assumes if you put the person on the moon, the disorder is still in their brain somewhere

### distress/dimensional model

assumes:

that every one is experiencing some degree of unpleasant things, but experience them to differing degrees

mental illnesses do not necessarily exist as independent entities rather, all people score somewhere on a continuum of psychological distress

disease is a misnomer

encourages us to think about mental beyond disorders

### the individual and society

if we reject the notion that "mental health" is merely a quality possessed by an individual, how might our ideas about mental health change?

we could think about the "mental health" of systems or networks of people

what might be signs of good societal mental health? social cohesion? productivity? stability? peace? 

### bhutan and gross national happiness

GNH gauges the "spiritual, physical, social, and environmental health of citizens and the natural environment" via national survey

bhutan is one of the poorest and countries and also one of the happiest. They consistently survey their citizens to measure GNH and attempt to make changes to increase it. 

might GNH reveal the ways in which mental health is social in nature?

### poor societal mental health

could societies be "mentally ill?"

indicators might include: lack of cohesion, high rates of fear, paranoia, aggression, crime, etc.

instances of poor societal mental health:

- moral panic? (fear of clowns, fear of satanic cults)
- mass psychogenic event? (dancing plauge)
- deep polarization?
- civil wars?

the idea could be used by people like politicians and those with the ability to enact change on the world to escape responsibility

### the course...

approaches mental health/illness broadly, focusing more on these concepts as broad spectrums of experience, rather than binary states.

asks how mental health as concepts, has come to play such a central role in our lives. what makes this possible? what are the consequences?

explore a tension: are mental health troubles the result of individual problems or broader social issues? should we try to "fix" the individual? can we "fix" society?

investigates why our mental health seems to be getting collectively worse?
