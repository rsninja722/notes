# temp notes

## adding binary numbers

add the same as decimal numbers

half adder

full adder

## sequential circuits

high level ideas: transistors, boolean functions, digital circuits

sequential circuits
more sophistecated
output

example - binary counter

combinatorial circuits

decoder/demultiplexor


## lecture 4

adders

ALU

has data in, data out, and control

implement hardware for additions subtraction and logic

control path and data path

### implementing memory

fixed logic circuits that maintain state, load operands and store results

latch

registers

propagation delay

the need to synchronize - clock with frequency of $f = \frac{1}{I}$

complex circuits have multiple clocks

flipflops
