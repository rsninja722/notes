## learning goals

1. Knowledge and understanding of the following concepts:
    - Basis of computation in digital logic;
    - Representation of integer and floating point numbers;
    - Interaction between processor, memory and I/O;
    - Instruction representation and Instruction Set Architecture;
    - Interaction between high- and low- level programming languages;
    - The functions and implementation of pipelining and parallelism in the CPU;
    - Virtual memory and caching;
    - Programmed and interrupt-driven I/O.
2. Skills and abilities to:
    - Convert between different number representations and reason about representation standards;
    - Program simple routines in MIPS assembly;
    - Interleave the use of assembly and C in a practical programming task;
    - Interpret and reason about Instruction Set Architectures;
    - Discuss and evaluate the design and performance of ISAs, memory hierarchies, and I/O systems;
    - Design and evaluate architecture choices.
