All evaluations in this course are individual in nature: no group work will be assigned. You may discuss the general ideas and concepts of the course material with your classmates However, your assignments/labs must be your individual effort. You may consult other sources, such as textbooks, but all such sources must be documented. Failure to do so will result in academic dishonesty charges.

Other Recommended Texts
- T.H. Cormen, C.E. Leiserson, R.L. Rivest, C. Stein, Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Ed., McGraw Hill, 2001
    - The preferred graduate-level algorithms reference book.
- J. Kleinberg, E. Tardos, Algorithm design, Addison-Wesley 2005
    - Assumes knowledge of basic data structures.
- M. Soltys, An Introduction to the Analysis of Algorithms, 2nd Ed., World Scientific
    - Excellent compact book focusing on algorithm analysis.

The language used in this course is Java. This course intentionally steers clear of the more esoteric features of Java, and focuses on those elements Java has in common with other C-Based languages, such as C and Python. Nevertheless, here is a Java reference book.

## course objectives 

By the end of this course, students will know and understand:

- Worst case analysis of algorithms
- Basic sorting algorithms, including
    - elementary sorts
    - quicksort
    - mergesort
    - heapsort
- Basic searching algorithms
    - binary search
    - search treas
    - hashing
- Elementary data structures
    - stacks
    - queues
    - priority queues
    - search trees
    - hash tables
    - tries
    - graph representations
- Graph algorithms
    - topological sort
    - breadth/depth-first-search
    - strongly connected components
    - minimum spanning trees
    - shortest paths
- Basic string algorithms

The student will be able to:

- Analyse the runtime of algorithms
- Identify the time/memory trade-offs in designing data structures and algorithms.
- Given a problem, such as searching, sorting, graph or string problems, select from a range of possible algorithms, providing justification for their selection.
- Understand implementation issues for the algorithms studied.
- Reduce (or decompose) a given application to problems already studied.
