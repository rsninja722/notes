how these declines came to establish themselves as important parts of our world, and how they generate knowledge, and how the knowledge works its way into society

## century of the psyences - 20th century

growth of size scope and importance of the psy-disciplines

in the extreme:

- arrival of "mental illness" expanded to include emotional and moral dimension (compared to madness)
- explaining emotionality/morality in the brain/mind, psy-disciplines freed people from consequence of action and implying their emotional/moral problem is permanent

how they behave/feel is because of things that happen to people - mental illness happens to you, you have a mental illness (durable)

daniel mcnaughten - not in his right mind when attempting murder, should not be held accountable

the range of what people shouldn't be held accountable for widens, frees people from accountability, and also condemns people

doing a personality quiz influences how people think of themselves

- in our culture - understaning, labeling, and reshaping mental processes became seen as central to many endeavours
    - we turn to psy-disciplines to "comprehend and surmount problems of the human conditions like despair, loss, conflict"
        - only in the last 150 years we have turned to science for answers instead of traditional elders, spiritual leaders
    - everyday  concerns like "sex, marriage, womanhood, and manhood; work, ambition, worldly failure, habits, desires, inclinations" are subject to being understood as psychological and potentially pathological
        - when calling something pathological - value judgments 
    - **pop psychology** - from decision making, to habits, to pickup culture.

- people became more concered with mental health as psy-disciplines and knowledge spreads
    - diagnoses shoot up - 20-50% of population likely to recieve a diagnoses at some point
    - other efforts focused on improving/protecting mental health
        - rise in mental health and wellness industries
        - psy knowledge has spread through schools, mass media, social media, police services, government service, etc.
- changes what it means to be human, and how we live our lives
- means that "mental health" being understood as something requiring immediate attention and sometimes drastic action

## freud

dividing figure

proponent of psychoanalysis - a theory and a treatment

TODO

experiences in youth unconcsciously affect our personality and 

- super ego - reflects societies opinions and values
- id - selfishness part of a person motivated by pleasure and aggression, satisfies personal desire
- ego - balances the two

mental health develops when the ego becomes overburdened, often in the youth

psychoanalysis was expensive and intense, change in clientel leading to a chnage of problems

- neuroses emerged

## psychoanalytic movement

psychoanalysis - now disavowed, but many ideas remain, way of thinking stuck

- established the mind was knowable
    - it was thought a psychoanalysis expert could discover anything about a human
- intesified belief that processes of the mind are knowable and changable
    - humans became seen as  calculable and categorizable
- focus on hitherto ignored emotions widened meaning of illness
- now not associated with medicine, asylums, or hospitals
- established the idea that talking can help with problems

## pre ww 2 climate

- marginal within medicines, seen as custodians rather than active healers
- asylums overflowing
- psychoanalysis was popular but faced resistance
    - beyond reach for many
    - brain and biology thought as the key, some practitioners thought psychoanalysis repugnant (antisemitism?)

    TODO

## heroic treatments - fevers, comas, and shocks

- julius wagner-jauregg's malarial  feaver therapy for geneal paresis
    - nobel prize wining
- insulin-coma therapy
- epilepsy and schizophrenia were "mirror image diseases" ladislas von meduna gave schizophrenic patients epileptic seizures through Cardiazol
- cerletti and BIni pioneered ECT to induce seizures as treatmnet
    - only ECT is still used today, though still divisive
    - conditioning through fear?
    - unusual but necesary


## aside

historically:

- psycocis - break from reality
- nerosis - emotional issues

## psyhosurgery (leucotomy, lobotomy)

- Egas Moniz - 1935
    - heard of parts or monkies brains being cut out leading to emotional change
    - developed leucotomy - cutting part of the frontal lobe out
    - claimed results were amazing
    - nobel prize in medicine for leucotomy
- freeman
    - transorbital lobotomy
    - toured hopstpitals to perform lobotomy because it was so renowned
    - lost licence becuse some children died because of it, lobotomys were banned
    - **lobotamobile**

## legacies and controversies of heroic treatment

- how well should we understant an intrevention before it's used?
    - ECT is still not fully understood
- who gets to define success? what does it mean for a treatment to "work"?
    - still a very relavent question. example: increase in ADHD diagnoses

- still able to find people who try to preserve an interest in biological approach

## psychopharmaceutical revolution

- laborit revolutionized mental healthcare with chlorpromazine
    - cheaper, safer, and quicker then heroic treatments
    - at the time called the "chemical lobotomy"
    - first "anti-psychotic" or first "major tranquilizer"
        - phrasing went from targeted to untargeted
    - prompted aother psychoactive drug experimentation, mood elevators, minor tranqualizers, stimulets
    
- prompted theraputic optimisim TODO

"treated illness"

## pharmaceuticalisation

provigil: being tierd isnt the problem, making a drug to keep you up shifts the problem onto the individual, away from society

psy diciplines help translate social problems into individual problems

- huge upswing in use of RX mends to manage ever-widening dimensions of mental health
- yet new treatments often herald new conditions
    - what is normal, abnormal, healthy, sick, safe, dangerous, manageable, ect. is tempered by psychopharmaceuticals
- drugs once used to alleviate "deficits" are shifting towards being used for enchancement, "lifestyle management", ect. even if the language stays the same
    - drugs now being used to push the limist of what is possible for humans
    - widespread epidemic of ADHD? or a personality trait that is attempted to be changed to "enhance" the person
    - when you take a drug and it provokes a change, you think "it fixed my condition", only if you think of it as a condition in the fist place
    - proccess slowly expands as more chemicals can do more

### pathway to pharmaceuticalisation

some theories as to how the rise in pharmaceuticalisation came to be

- immense trust and fait put in sicence from the 1950s onwards (provoked by moon landing, tupperware, ext.)
    - developed belief that science can alliveate all ills whether personal or social
- reassures, pace, and competitiveness of modern life makes quick fixes attractive
- consumerism creates an implicit trust and faith in things we can buy, hold, and consume
    - nothing material to show for community and social support
- "netural" and "objective" clinical expertise is inherently trusted 

## reasons for growth in psy-ences

- scientific advancements, thus justifying  more attention, respect, and power
    - belief that science constantly improves life
- professional expansion?
    - as the professions grew in population, they claimed more legitimacy over ever-increasing domains of human life
    - as a researcher you have to reseach new things, you have to keep expanding the feild of interest/feild of authority
- cultural shift?
    - hyper rationality post-enlightenment?
        - everything can be known, everything is calculable
    - psy-discplines facilitate self-governence by transforming people into calculable, measureable beings, constantly working to ensure our feelings and behaviours stay witin paticualr boundries
    - neoliberalsim promots self responsibilization, society isn't a thing, everything is up to the individual

    TODO define neoliberalism / make ideology note

        states will disinsentivise certain things and interfere with free markets

    TODO lassez-faire

    political and economic philosophy - structures our world now - assumes that the best way to resolve human problems is through the creation of markets (competing forces) competition in markets leads to the best results, for the markets to work the best there should be no regulation/interfearance, government should be small so it does not interfear with natural market forces. there is no such thing as society, we are indepentent individual actors who will maximize our own potential and own good, which will benifit everyone
