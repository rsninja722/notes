# from madness to mental illness

over past 250 years idea has shifted from "madness" to "mental illness" 

madness was a limited term, narrow range of things that would make someone mad

mental illness is more broad, many of thoses with mental illness would not be considered mad

- "illness" suggests something a physician can/should remedy

central questions

- has mental illness been on the rise and why?
- how did mental healthcare become professionalized? (dont think of professionals as always truthful or moral)
- what are the concequences of moving to a very medical apporach

not a story of progress, more so a story of change

be wary of "scientific progress"

## pre institutional history

hard to compare the past to the preset 

all that we can say is that in the distant past, people described behaviours that sound like our mental health problems

hippocrates and galen placed madness in body, yet many contempories saw other expplanations, there was no monopoly on the explanation

wards for the mad existed in the early islamic world, not fully medicalized

medival europe explained: grounded in the body, divine, supernatural, spiritual

- monastary stays, burning at the stake, bloodletting, family care, whipping, etc.

dont overgeneralize, both compasionate and cruel, medical and non-medical repsones existed

- trepidation - drilling a hole in the skull
    - seen all over the world in the past
    - can help if brain is swelling 
    - might have been used to "release demons"?

## bethlem (bedlem) hospital

means chaos, destruction

established in the 14th century, heavy use of restraints

TODO bedlem poem

why did madness come to be feared?


## moralizing madness

TODO moralizing madness: hogarth's 18th century "A Rakes Progress

tom rake loses a bunch of money, and ends up in bedlem

bedlam opened as a tourist site, regarded as a freak show

people would sneak in booze, sexually assault patients

1770 tourism was banned because the crowds could not be controlled

highlights important trends

- stigmatization of mad individuals
- TODO

many justified madness as punishment, said the person invited upon them selves

## vagrancy act 1714

differentiated "pauper (poor) lunatics" from "vagrants, sturdy beggars, rouges"

- charged local authories w/ apprehending individuals who "By lunacy, or otherwise, are furiously mad and dangerous to be permitted to go abroad"
- such inividuals were considered not just bad, but were dangerous to be in public, and should be seperated from society, no punishment or treatment, just confinement

a recognition that the mad were not to blame for their problems

recognition of mad vs other devience

also says the government to try to predict dangerousness of individuals

## rise of private madhouses

new basis for confinement sparked "trade in lunacy"

anyone with property could be payed by the government/privately to store a lunatic

custodial care, not treatment

consequences?

- incentive to keep costs low
- became awful places to be
- concerns over wrongful confinement

## 1774 act for regulating madhouses (60 years later)

- madhouses must be inspected and licensed by royal college of physicians

- now a legal basis for linking medical field with madness, medicalization of madness

gives a legitimacy

- involuntary confinement possible only after a doctor and justice of the peace signed off on it

- state now involved in regulating madness beyond dangerousness

# lecture 4

## enlightenment and modernity

- enlightenment - period of history with bit advances in science/philosophy. also a cultural period
    - reason and rationality
    - transition from religion to science
    - new political philosophies highlighted individualism, liveralism, individual
    - applying reason and science to madness

### tukes and the york retreat

- began to challange the perception of the mad being a lost cause
- the mad were given the freedom to walk the grounds and work the land
- the idea was the if treated with kindness, the mad would respond well
- helped launch the "moral treatment" movement

### moral treatment - philippe pinel

- beleived they were discconected from reason - the highest human virtue
- beleived he could use "theraputic conversation" to improve the reasoning ability of the mad who were not "lost causes"
- believed if treated w/ diginity, kindess and discipline, the patient could recover their reason

### moral treatment - rise of the treatment asylum

- Jean-Etienne Esquirol (early 19th century)
- suggested doctors need special training for treating the mad
- offered classes on "maladies mentales"
- treatment needed to manifest in the architecture of the asylums
    - regiment itself is therapeutic
    - institutions should be placed away from cities
        - thought their was something about urban life was the cause of mental illness/madness

### moral treatment - basic tenets

- kindness and understaning should guid treatment
- patients active role in own treatment
- purpose build asylums
    - calm settings, large grounds, farmland: self suffiecent and help patients
    - architechure was inportant, no bars, bright, airy, rational segregation of patients by gender/disorder
    - prioritiezd discipline and routine through scheduled activities, excersise, etc.
    - restraint to be used sparingly, not to incite terror
    - MD-patient relationship as itself imortant

## asylum building era

19th cetury many massive state institutings, explosion in patient population

- moving away from using as a punishment

- rise in a new profession, the alienist (psyciatrists) (people were alienated from their body)

## legacy of asylums

- "good intentions gone bad"
- moral treatment gave way to custodianship TODO: lookup
- too many patients eventually
- some suggest psychiatry "lost touch" with medicine
- loss of reputation for psychiatry - so few people actively improve, nothing to show compared to other advances (germ theory, surgery)

## huge boom in patient population

### social control - the great confinement

- foucault: rise cause by growing state authoritarianism
    - those how were identified as mentally ill those who did not accept or fit into new political and economic logic of a society built upon rationalism and efficiency
    - people who could not handle 16 hour work days were labeled as mentally ill
    - confined bot for humanitarian or medical reasons but for control
    - emphasis on regiment was for more control of workers

### social control - scull

- scull: asylums as "dumping grounds" for society's unwanted
- psychiatry's upper middle class trying to impose order and control on lower classes
    - using mental illess to justify  trying to correct things they didn't like like sex and drinking
- lumber room thesis - if you build an asylum for the mentally ill, you will fill it or the mentally ill, the asylums weren't in response to anything, but a cause for more mentally ill
    - like modern for profit prisons
    - growing number of patients during 19th and early 20th centurt reflected the widespread labelling of undesirable behavior TODO

### critisisims of social control theory

- romantisizes situation of the mad prior to the enlighenment
- wright: not a conspiracy between the state and psychiatry, but families coping with industrial revolution, the conditions were a problem, but families would go to asylums to cope with the revloution
- the "rise" wasn't about social control, but rather that people were diverted from other institutions TODO

### was there a real rise in insanity

real rates changed on account of the industrial revolution and urbanization

theories:

- dietary changes (gluten and potatoes)?
- alcohol consumptions?
- more toxins (insecticides, latex)?
- more disease (syphilis 3rd stage cause mental illness)?
- mass migration?

dring 18 to 19 century madness transformed into mental illness
