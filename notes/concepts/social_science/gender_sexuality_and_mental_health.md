# gender, sexuality, and mental health

## key questions
- do men and women experience similar rates of mental pathology
    - is mental illness  TODO
- how might distress be genderd
- TODO

## hysteria

one of the most studied issues

thought to be age old, with ever changing symptomology including:
- fits
- losing ability to use limbs
- angry, iritable
- exusted
- losing ability to see
- highly emoitional

- micale: a dramatic metaphor for everything that men found mysterious TODO

in ancient world:

the womb was blamed "a roming uterus"

- indicative of tendency to somatize womens mental health TODO - define
- gender norms (and violation) thought to be linked to mental health

medeval/early modern times:

- explanations sometimes centered on witchcraft and demons

post industrial revolution

- exmplained hysteria as a consequence of women's constitutional weakness
- shifting symptomology reflected "unpredictable nature" of women's bodies
- common treatment for hystareia - "hysterical paroxysms" (orgasms through vibration, vibrators originally marketed as a health treatment)

20th centry

- freud and others reimagined hysteria along psychological lines

- term "hysteria" replaced by "conversion disorder"

### uses of hysteria

- imagined symptoms and causes reflect shifting ideas about gender, including the behaviours "appropriate" for women
- both "pathologized and protected" women - by pathologizing, frames as something beyond one's control - freeing from some responsability (pathologize - frame as illness)

- symptoms be understood as a form of resistance against gender norms (suffragettes, educated women)
- could be seen as a medicalization of a male defensive response to femal assertiveness
- a (subconscious) strategy for the powerless? example: hysterical leg paralysis (thought of as a protest or resistance of whats expected because of the lack of power)

hysteria as evidence of
- how biological difference can be weponized to explain mental health problems 
- how expressions of distress themselves can be gendered
- how gender norms structure understnadings of mental illness (example: bipolar personality dissorder)

## symptom repertoire

set of recognizeable determinates for a condition

## abuse of psychology for political means

those who spoke out against the state were diagnosed - their ideas were labeled 

## gender and mental health imbalances

- intopunitive 
    - shame
    - doupt
    - anxiety

- "intopunitive" emotions self-reported more often by women
    - diagnosed more often with axiety, depression, EDs, some PDs
- "externalizers" (anger, aggression) self reported by men
    - diagnosed more often with substance-use disorders, anti-social behavioural disorders

competing explanations
- real differences based on physiology
- real differences based on social conditions and socialization
- false differences based on research/diagnosic bias (men more likely to volenteer for experiments for medication, women more likely to put themselves forward for mental health diagnoses, men represented more in the justice system)

## sources of stress

- women tend to self-identify as having mental health problems more commonly, also diagnosed at a higher rate
- is this related to distress? if women experience more distress why? proposed explanations:
    - exposure to harm
    - fewer resources (purchasing power - women concentrated in service industry (insurance differences), bad parental leave compensation)
    - dual burden (carer and house work)
    - "female roles" - more stifling, less socially rewarding
- case study: "supermoms"
    - "intensive mother ideologies" linked to negative effects on mental health
        - increased stress, anxiety, guildt, decresed sense of self-efficacy
    - effects found in "supermoms" and those in their social circles

## gender and anorexia

women diagnoesd at a rate 7-10x that of men

possible explanations
- differing standard of beauty for men and women
    - slimness for women
    - muscularity for men
- women socialized into giving up control - especially to families. "well behaved" women seeking control
    - anorexia is a form of rebelion and attempt at control over own life
    - idea divides feminist theorists: some support, some reject bevause it values "male personality traits" as ideal: autonomy, independence, emotional distance
- Bordo (post-structural fenitist): a form of resistance to maternal body and the "suffocation destiny of reproductive motherhood"

## suicide

common finding: women attept suicide more frequently, men are more likely to complete suicide more frequently

possible explanations
- higher rates of testoterone/aggression lead to more lethal attempts (different methods for attempts)
- men socialized into traits like decisiveness, not failing, not giving up - masculine gender norms leads to making completed suicide more likely
    - men more to have access to more effective menthods (example: guns)
- womens preferred methods reflect a gendered expectation to preserve beauty

previous examples predicated on belief real differences exist in the mental health problems experienced by women and men

## resons for differences

### expressing mental disorder

theory: experience does not differ, counting differs (due to different expressions of symptoms)

suggestion: male and female variants of depression, only female variant easily recognizable

- "female depression" - internalizing behaviours/feelings, somatic symptoms
- "male depression" - exhaustion, irritability, restlessness, substance use

hard to debate since there is no way to know if someone is depressed

### reporting

suggestions:
- women report mental health concerns to doctors more often
- men less likely to report mental health due to socialization ("feminine")
    - favour "non-mental health words" example: "burnout" vs. "depression"
- differences not solely related to gender. some ment more likely to report, example: more educated, have intimate partner, chronic illness and disability

### diagnostics and treatment

shifts responsibility away from the people being diagnosed onto the researchers/doctors

suggestions:
- research/diagnostic bias
- with non-immediately observable complaints, MDs tend to assume men's problems are organtic, women's problems are psychosomatic
- women less likely to receive advanced diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, more likely to receive medical prescription

## case study: femal sexual dysfunction

- some scholars point to mental disorders related femal sexal dysfunction as evidence of clinical and research bias

- female orgasmic disorder
    - from the DSM: "any difficulty or delay in reaching orgasm that causes the women personal distress." can we separate distress TODO
    - diagnosable if a women doesn't orgasm from "sufficient stimulation"
- sexual interest/arousal disorder
    - US data: 32% of women "have it", more than 2x the rate of men
    - symptoms include "discrepancies in desire" and being "typically unreceptive to a partner's attemos to initiate

- for scholors, these disorders and their criteria heavily reflective of traditional medical (male) gaze

gendered ideas built into the diagnostic tools

## queer mental health

sexualities and gender identies TODO

- homosexuality delisted from the DSM in 1980, replaced with "ego-dystonic sexuality" (distress over being having same-sex attraction) until mid 1980s
- queer individuals appear to be at greater risk for poor mental health
    - TODO

### sources of distress

theories on sources of additional distress:
- predjudice, social exclusion, coming out process, internalized stigma, heteronomativity
- siginificantly elevated reates of physical and sexual assult
- could this be about broader social determinats 
    - example: in ontario, >50% of trans individuals live on <$15k, much more likely to experience homelessness
- discrimination within the healthcare system itself

### when care causes distress

- case study: gender identity disorder, first appeared in DSM III
    - DSM IV: boys who want to wear dresses, girls who refues to wear them...
    - boys roughly 6x more likely than girls to be diagnosed with GID
    - conversion therapy applied to restore "normal gender identiy"
- DSM 5: terminology shifted to gender dysphoria

TODO

## conclusions

- mental health differeces between sexes and genders complex, related to social determinates, medical assumptions, and perhaps physiological differences
- throughout recent history, transgressing gender and sexual norms identifie both as "proff" of mental disorder, as well as cause of distress
