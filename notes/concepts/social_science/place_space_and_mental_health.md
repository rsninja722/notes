## recall about mental health

- "mental health" is a more expansive concept than the absence of a diagnosable disorder
    - defined by feeling good and functioning well <- inherently social

## social determinants of health

the factors that are beyond those which are internal and intreinsic to a person.

non-medical factors that influence health outcomes

"conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age ... shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources."

- examples
    - race - to racialization
    - gender

        - housing
        - food and water

**racialized** - how a social proccess perscribes a person value

## space versus place

space is physical

place is the meaning perscribed to a place 

### example

high score on surveys for poor mental health in a housing estate space that had a negative stigma associated with it, a few years later, the scores were much better - after cleaning up the area and fixing the space

demonstrates that mental halth can be greatly affected by the space and place a person inhabits

### economic stratification

class impacts mental health

## social causation

### neighborhoods 

urban environment itseft can be a sourcc of poor mental health

    - more greenery
    - less noise
    - closer proximity to nature

TODO

# nature

# greenspace

- can be mitigated if parts are considerd dangourus 

## conclusuions

we can think of mental health as if people have something or not, or a variable that all people have that relates to a sense of ontrol, feeling of belonging, social connection, and having purpose in one's life

social determinants have tremendous importance in shaping mental health outcomes

its not that things that intrinsic to the person don't matter, its that only focusing on that is a limited way of thinking
