Despite the great attention western countries pay to the mind and human consciousness in philosophy and the arts, disturbances of mental health remain not only neglected but also deeply stigmatised across our societies

western world defineitely trys

the WHO has promised to tackle mental health, but has not provided adequate funding / failed to establish any sustainable systems

responsibility should lie with world bank, country donors, foundations, researh funding bodies, and professional assotiations


## Horton: Launching a New Movement for Mental Health:
- mental health is a neglected aspect of human well-being, intimately connected with many other conditions of global health importance
- resources for mental health are inadequate, insufficient, and inequitably distributed
- there is already a strong evidence base on which to scale up mental health service
- most low-income and middle- income countries currently devote far too few resources to mental health
- there are critical lessons to learn from past successes and failures — for:
    - political leadership and priority setting
    - increasing financial support
    - decentralising mental health services
    - integrating mental health into primary care
    - increasing health workers trained in mental health
    - strengthening public health perspectives in mental health
- any call to action demands a clear set of indicators to measure progress at country level

## clark: medicalization of global health
- mental health issues now make up 13% of the total disease burden
    - 70% of the burden lies in low and middle-income countries
- Movement for Global Mental Health 
    - focuses on treatment gap, aims to scale-up health services and treatment coverage for mental disorders in all countries   
- as mental health is globalising, it brings much needed attention to the issue of mental health, but also creates conditions for disease mongering and medicalization


- **medicalization** - application of a biomedical model that sees health as freedom from disease

- arguments
 - shared biology unifies experiences across cultures
    - counter: disease categories are socially and historically constructed is shown by the fact that homosexuality was a classified mental illness until 198
    - cross-cultural evidence shows how depression in the medicalized fashioning may in others be ‘thinking too much’, ‘fall of heart or mind’, or sadness, or depending on the social circumstances may be distress due to displacement, conflict, injustice, or social suffering
- financial insentive: International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers’ Association highly commended WHO for its leadership and affirmed the pharmaceutical industry’s active engagement in the ‘fight against mental and neurological disorders’ with over 200 compounds said to be in research and development 
-  mental health pharmaceutical market valued in the 10s of billions - hundreds of dollars per person

- research in India suggested, medication treatment may be more acceptable to individuals with common mental health issues than non-pharmaceutical approaches such as talking therapies, especially in a group environment 
- medical labels can be double edged

## critiques 3

- summerfield - worked in sub-saharn africa, critical of global mental health unit
    - global mental health won't work, as its based on concepts that aren't meaningful for those being treated in some contries/culturs/communities
    - in some cultures, not talking about things is a strategy to forget and move on from difficult circumstances, so trying to run talk therapy for PTSD, removes agency by telling people "you do have PTSD, and here is what to do about it"
        - not saying that the PTSD doesn't exist, say that trying to enforce a specific treatment could cause more harm than good
    
- jain and jadhav - community mental health services set up across the global south are isolated from the community, and dissconnect TODO

- when a botswonina learned about ADHD, they said "isnt this just describing young boys?"

## critiques 4

- other areas of the world are interpreted as untapped markets
- global mental health movement sometimes frames some mental ilnesss as leading to lower ecenomic productivity

## critiques 5

- **imperialism** - a policy of extending a collective's power and influence through diplomacy or military force

- GMH is a form of psychiatric imperialism
- Kirmayer - global south is effectively prevented from contributing to knowledge production of this "global science"
    - most scientific confreces/journals are in english, and come with costs
    - GMH claims that the science contains universal truths even though it is only developed in northamerica and western eruope
- summerfield - GMH workers should be tought of as the new religous missionaires - modernizing, educating, civilizing
    - the notition of a group "laking mental health literacy" assumes they should think like us, and we don't need to understand their ideas
- others cultures are framed as an "obstacle for understanding"
- not only is a framework for understanding suffering being globalized, the idea of what it means to be a human, and person hood itself is also globalized

## decolonizing mental health unit

those who reject absolutist/universalist approach have pushed against biological-reductionist perspectives

TODO

"ethnopsychiatries"

## conclusions

- global mental health movement aims to atalyze interest and funding for mental health, seeing mental health porblems as a barrier to development and the source of hidden suffering
