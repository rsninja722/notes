# experts of the soul 

Joseph Stalin coined the term "engineers of the soul" to refer to writers under his government

psychological expertise has made itself indispensable to modern life in western societies. How should this phenomenon be understood? - in the terms of expertise - a social authority

notion of expertise enables us to distinguish between:
- occupational advancement of a particular professional sector
- spread of a particular mode of thought and technique
- transformation of practices of regulation

seperation between the social concequences of psychology, and psychologists

other fields adopt psycholoigcal ways of thinking because of the justification/guide to action it provides

psychology provides a rational, systematic and simple dealing with unpredictable human conduct

psychology is technical, aiming to producde outcomes of efficiency, reform, education, cure, or virtue

psychology has no institution of its own, grafts onto other professions

tests can be used to look at a person as a number, but also shift judgmnets to the sphere of human truth

ethicalizes power of autorities

provides ethical means of excersizing authority, not an external truth (ex. divine) but a truth that is internal to the person being controlled.

the relation between expert and client is structured by a hierarchy of wisdom

medicalization done by lay people

some scholars tie it to the rise in neoliberalism

TODO define positivism

## questions

- how can we explain the emergence of positive psychology?
- how has positive psychology 

TODO

## arival of cognitive behavioral treatment

- roots in early 20th centry behaviourism (watson, pavlov, skinner), itself informed by positivism
    - psychology should adapt the scientific method only focus on things that can be observed and classified (ex. behaviour), not on introspection
    - behaviour is fundementally learned

- mid 20th centry recognized human behaviour is filtered through thoughts
    - ellis: the distress people feel is often not from the event itself, but from the toughts about the event
    - beck: *automatic thoughts* are identifiable and treatable

- by 21st centry, treatment methods emerge with an emphisis on reshaping thoughts, CBT is the leading modality 

## emergence of positive psychology

- as cbt is replacing psychoanalysis, in the 1990's, Seligman had an "epiphany" - his grumpyness arrises from his thought proccess, thoughts arrise first which lead to behaviour
- elected as head of american psychological assotiation said psychology must turn away from "the negative" and from peoples issues, to study the "universal science of happiness"
- Csikszentmihayli - interested in how people that survived WW2 in the face of terrible events could remain optimistic and happy
    - flow - people got into a proccess and could focus on the positives

## key tenets of positive pshycology

- emotions are learned because they come from thoughts, thoughts are also learned
    - inverts freudian theouy that feelings/emotions drive thoughts (themselves product of life experiences)
- positive outlook is good for you, negative is bad, happiness has a looping "multiplier effect"
- positivity can improve all aspects of life
- strive to augment individual's ability to prevent mental illness
    - TODO
    - mental illess can be kept at bay if people thought the right things

- manefesting

## explosion of positive psychology

- started as a movement in an acedemic industry, expanded through media, academia, and professional practice
- clinitions started to integrated positive psychology into their work
- claim that there was a "science" of happiness, optimism is good for virtually all aspects of life
    - "healing effects" - 
        - fredrickson: positivity undoes damaged  that negativity causees to the cardio system
        - segerstrom: positive thoughts boost the immune system
- discorse infiltrates everyday practice
    - gratitude excercises, TODO
- new wellness industry TODO

## mindfulness

- roots of buddhism
- rise due to hippies, simplified for mass consumption
- used by positive psychology as a teachable technique to gaurd against mental health problems, increase life satisfaction, aid learning
- need to be hyper aware of our feelings, always being aware of negative emotions/thoughts
- scolarly critiques
    - reveley: imparts self responsibilization, aligns closely with neoliberalism
    - barker: despite non-medical practice, reinforces dirstress and discomfort as illness which necessitates treatment.

## the happiness turn

- the happiness turn - intellectual and cultural shift
- ahmed: happiness used to be a cinceptual ideal, not an achiveable state, something people worked towards. that vision gave way to the idea that hapiness can be concretely achived, identified and measured, hapiness should always be persued. created a perscription for happiness
- discourse of happiness is everywhere, norms of what is good, desireable, healthy, and prosperous
- not pursuing happiness is a sign that the individual is a failure
- "other" types of hapiness are often not discussed, even looked down upon ("guilty" pleasures)
- ultimately happiness is a choice

## decontextualizing happiness

- many scholarly critiques
- "unviversal truths" about the "science of hapiness" often grounded in culture of individualism
- take hapiness out of the social context, assumptions about hapiness only apply to some with the luxury of their circumstance 

**we have to insolate ourselves against misforture, instead of changing the environment around us**

- positive psychology is a response to and enabler of neoliberalism

## science of positive psychology

critiques:

- perez-alvarez: positive psychology isises the "autority" of science to mask its underlying ideological character
- wilson: mindfulness uses the rhetoric of science to shift expertise from religion/philosophy to the medical realm

stock put in science uncritically, not much stock put in religion

- positive psychology tautologies "those who are more satisfied with there life are more happy" - circular argument

## happiness as imperative

- cabanas: happiness presented as the logical consequece of following the "science" of happiness functions as a set of "ought tos". failing to achive happiness is thought of as a sign of individual malfunction
- held: "tyranny of positive attitude" be happy or face the concequences
    - obscures the "benifits of the negative" (anxiety could be useful if there is something to be anxious about)
- ehrenreich ("smile or die" book)

## further critiques

- assumes how we feel can be measured biologically, and predicted on a universal human being

- critics: wellness industry preys upon insecurites regarding being well, happiness understood as an imperative
- what we assign as "proper" sources of happiness may police certain activities

## conclusion

- by 21st century, psy-disciplines focused on psyche as learned, rooted in cognitive frameworks
    - feelings start as thoughts
- arrival of positive psychology reflects and perpetuates a broader trend wherein human beings imagined as measureable, caterizable
- claims scientific domain over wider array of human feelings, thoughts, and behaviour
