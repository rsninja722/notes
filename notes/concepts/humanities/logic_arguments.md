# logic - arguments

## history

6 logical works by Aristotle were grouped together into the *Organon*

logic was seen as a tool to philosophers, as an instrument of all human reasoning

## definitions 

- **deductive argument** - "A discourse in which when certain things are laid down something else follows of necessity in virtue of their being so" - Aristotle, *Prior Analytics*
- **statement** - a sentence (or part of a sentence) that expresses something true or false
    - examples: "I have a pet dinosaur", "2+2=4"
        - "I watched a movie and it was bad" - compound statement
    - not examples: "stay in school", "is bruce wayne batman?"
- **inference** -  is the drawing of a conclusion from one or more other statements given as premises
- **conclusion** -  is a statement inferred from one or more other statements. These other statements are the premises of the inference
- **argument** - a chain of (one or more) inferences from some initial premises to an overall conclusion
    - not a dispute between people

## propositions

the "something" a statement expresses has traditionally been called a proposition

- **proposition** - what a statement expresses as true of false
    - example - "juliet is the sun" - this expresses a proposition like "juliet is beautiful"


## arguments

premises | conclusion
---|---
if its a clear day, ill go to the beach. its a clear day | so ill go to the beach

extended arguments:

inference - step you take to generate another statement

premises | inference | premise | overall conclusion
---|---|---|---
if its a clear day, ill go to the beach. its a clear day | so ill go to the beach | whenever I go to the beach I get sunburned | so im going to get sunburned

- premise indicators - because... | since... | given that... | assume... | for the following reasons...
- conclusion indicators - therefore... | so... | consequently... | hence... | it follows that

### example argument - gravity

Now, since all terrestrial and celestial bodies on which we can make any experiments or observations are heavy, it must be acknowledged without exception that gravity belongs to all bodies universally – Newton, *Principia*

- **Premise** - All terrestrial and celestial bodies on which we can make any experiments or observations are heavy
- **Conclusion** - Gravity belongs to all bodies universally
- **unstated premise** - heavy things have gravity

### example argument - god

The biblical version of the creation of the universe 'on the first day' is vague about what exactly was involved. There are actually two accounts of creation, but neither explicitly mentions that the material from which the stars and planets, the earth, and our own bodies are made, existed prior to the creation event. The belief that God created this cosmic material out of nothing is a longstanding part of Christian doctrine. Indeed, it seems to be demanded by the assumption of God's omnipotence, for if God did not create matter it would imply that he was limited in his work by the nature of the raw material available to him. –P.C.W. Davies, *God and the New Physics*

- **Premise** - God is omnipotent (all powerful)
- **Premise** - If god did not create matter out of nothing then he would not be omnipotent (all powerful)
- **Conclusion** - So, God created matter out of nothing


## implicit arguments

sometimes parts of arguments that are essential, are assumed to be known and are left out

### example:

- implicit - Where everything is good, nothing can be unjust, justice being inseparable from goodness – Rousseau, Emile
- explicit - Where everything is good, nothing can be unjust [ since ] justice [ is ] inseparable from goodness

## enthymemes

- **enthymemes** - argument with one or more premises/conclusions that are unstated
