## being logical is not the same as being right

logic - derived from the greek *logos* meaning "reason" - has many definitions along with the word logical.

logic: 

1. 
    - 
        1. science that deals with the principles and criteria of validity of inference and demonstration : the science of the formal principles of reasoning
        2. a branch of semiotics
        3. the formal principles of a branch of knowledge the logic of grammar
    - 
        1. a particular mode of reasoning viewed as valid or faulty
        2. RELEVANCE, PROPRIETY (ex. "could not understand the logic of such an action")
    - interrelation or sequence of facts or events when seen as inevitable or predictable
By the logic of events, anarchy leads to dictatorship.
    - the arrangement of circuit elements (as in a computer) needed for computation
2. something that forces a decision apart from or in opposition to reason

logical:

1. 
    - 
        1. of, relating to, involving, or being in with logic
        2. skilled in logic
    - formally true or valid : ANALYTIC, DEDUCTIVE
2. capable of reasoning or of using reason in an orderly cogent fashion

calling oneself logical provides little information without clarification what is meant.

a circle only truly exists as a theoretical concept, and the best attempts to create a physical circle will always have some imperfection whether it be at a visible scale, atomic scale, or quantum scale. in much the same way, logic only exists as a concept, and attempts at creating logical systems in the physical world are always imperfect. computers are the most logical complex structures we know of and even they are susceptible to factors that violate the axioms of logic, such as cosmic rays changing bits, or physical components breaking down. $True \land True$ is always true theoretically, but if implemented in the real world, there is a small chance the output bit could be flipped resulting in a result of false instead of true.

humans with there biological and ever physically changing brains, are susceptible to even more factors than computers that could violate the axioms of logic.

being logical just means one attempts to think and reason a certain way, it should not imply consistency or being factual.
