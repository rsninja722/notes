# thinking critically about mental health and illness

mental health focuses mainly on thoughts, mood, and behavior

we normally imagine metal health as being inside a persons brain/mind. some say it can be traced to biology/personal experience

these approaches miss the way in which mental health is necessarily social in nature

mental health can be impacted by social conditions and climate

mental health is judged in relation to norms (example: bizarre affect - measured against norms)

judgments about if we're behaving in a mentally healthy way is made by others. when getting assessed for a mental illness, you go through a social process where someone interviews you.

markers of mental health (good or bad) are concerned with how we relate to others and with society more broadly 


"Theres all this talk about, high rent prices, high cost of living, droughts, forest fires, flood, war, political polarization, and so on. And there is also an increase in mental health diagnoses, antidepressant prescriptions, and talk about mental health awareness. WTF?"

"if you go see someone about mental health issues because of the state of the world, you get prescribed medication and told to meditate" often we as a society try to address the symptoms instead of the cause of the symptoms.

## what does good mental health mean?

there is no generally accepted definition

broader definitions are more common typically include:

the ability to

- get on with everyday life
- connect with other people
- enjoy oneself
- handle stress, discomfort, and change <- relates to the resources/materials they posses
- pursue goals and interests <- structured by social circumstances

## poor mental health

measures of more mental health also measure against society and social norms

### disorder approach

the disorder/categorical approach:

"has"

assumes mental illnesses exist as  discrete categories

some disorders are almost entirely social (eg. SAD), many other common symptoms rooted in social relationships (eg. paranoia, valorization/vilification, arguments with others)

highly individualized, it assumes disorder are intrinsic. assumes if you put the person on the moon, the disorder is still in their brain somewhere

### distress/dimensional model

assumes:

that every one is experiencing some degree of unpleasant things, but experience them to differing degrees

mental illnesses do not necessarily exist as independent entities rather, all people score somewhere on a continuum of psychological distress

disease is a misnomer

encourages us to think about mental beyond disorders

## the individual and society

if we reject the notion that "mental health" is merely a quality possessed by an individual, how might our ideas about mental health change?

we could think about the "mental health" of systems or networks of people

what might be signs of good societal mental health? social cohesion? productivity? stability? peace? 

### bhutan and gross national happiness

GNH gauges the "spiritual, physical, social, and environmental health of citizens and the natural environment" via national survey

bhutan is one of the poorest and countries and also one of the happiest. They consistently survey their citizens to measure GNH and attempt to make changes to increase it. 

might GNH reveal the ways in which mental health is social in nature?

### poor societal mental health

could societies be "mentally ill?"

indicators might include: lack of cohesion, high rates of fear, paranoia, aggression, crime, etc.

instances of poor societal mental health:

- moral panic? (fear of clowns, fear of satanic cults)
- mass psychogenic event? (dancing plauge)
- deep polarization?
- civil wars?

the idea could be used by people like politicians and those with the ability to enact change on the world to escape responsibility

## the course...

approaches mental health/illness broadly, focusing more on these concepts as broad spectrums of experience, rather than binary states.

asks how mental health as concepts, has come to play such a central role in our lives. what makes this possible? what are the consequences?

explore a tension: are mental health troubles the result of individual problems or broader social issues? should we try to "fix" the individual? can we "fix" society?

investigates why our mental health seems to be getting collectively worse?

## the rise of mental health

how often are things discussed in reference to mental health?

one of the most powerful concepts of our time. shapes polices and regulations everywhere, even though mental health is loosely defined

what allowed this to come into existence?

from 1800s onwards much of humanly has been wrapped up in urbanization and industrialization <- new phenomenon creating new social problems

there is no evidence of addictions from 150 years ago

people seek solutions/explanations for these new problems, find mental health

- secularization de-emphasized the soul; the mind takes its place 

religion is on the decline

science replaced religion as a conceptual authority. religion used to explain why people would act in ways we didn't want, used to be able to blame the soul, now we blame the mind

new political trends put greater priority for the wellbeing of the everyday citizens

1900s: remarkable and destructive change (WW, colonization, holocaust, partitioning of south asia)

- what are the impacts on people, how would we examine
- how would we prevent these things in the future (after ww2 looked into the phycology of conflict and war)

WHO (1946) with a new definition of health: not just a lack of disease/injury, instead a more encompassing complete state of physical mental and social state

governments starts thinking of how to prevent mental health problems as a society

concerns are social, responses are largely individual

## the psy-disciplines and psy-complex

psychiatry and psychology - concerned with "the mental" and how to regulate it. these professions have only grown in size over the last 150 years

- how do we make people better? (problem solving, happiness)

- amount of workers in this field has grown as well as the scope as their work, weighing in on more aspects on life

persistent grief disorder (scope widening to grief)

psy-complex: tools and knowledge of psy-discipline
- journals, conferences, professional associations, institutions, tools (scales, tests, therapeutic modality, RX)
- what is "true" within the complex may not be true outside

the epistemological world created by ^ is only one way of thinking of the world

knowledge and tools have spread far beyond their psy-professions into many other realms (metal health in schools)

## beyond healing

they argue that the psy-complex is not about healing but enforcing a certain type of social order 

psy disciplines as powerful social actors, setting acceptable limits of behavior and providing techniques/rationale to regulate behavior


power is not a top down hierarchy in the modern world

power is exercised at the level of  the population, we exercise power, often without knowing we are doing so. at the micro level

psy-complex exerts power with its influence, not with the intention of exercising power

its not an evil conspirency, there is no single entity excerting power, the power is diffuse

- **DSM** - list of mental disorders and their symptoms, constantly changes, reflecting how society changes

the DSM is a tool that disceminates the psy-complex, we think of it as science and therefore as a factual authority

science is a tool used by humans, it is not a force on its own. has immense rhetorical value

medicalization - causing more facets of human existence are coming to be understood through a prisim of the categorical approach

there has been a push for 

this knowledge has filtered down to lay people, tiktokers will learn this information, and present it to the general populus in a lay way

the idea of mental health can be used to condition behavior (a 14 year old on their phone, not a shadow government)

## theraputic tools

lay activities: diet, medication, yoga, exercise, art, music, positive thinking, pets, etc.

assisted individual interventions

psyco therapy

TODO add

thought of not only as tools of healing, but serve as a way to regulate behavior

how can we treat society as a whole?


 
1. defining mental health is complex
2. social in nature
3. how it has become so prominent
4. why do we have a mental health crises in a society of abundance
