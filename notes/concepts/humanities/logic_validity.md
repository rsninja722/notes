# validity

consider the argument

- premise - most lottery tickets are not winners
- premise - I bought a lottery ticket
- conclusion - that ticket is probably not a winner

these are induction arguments. 

- **strong argument** -when the premises in an inductive argument give good reasons for accepting the likelihood of th econclusion


## deductive arguments

- A discourse in which when certain things are laid down something else follows of necessity in virtue of their being so – Aristotle, *Prior Analytics*
- aristotle called these arguments **syllogisms**, close to modern notion of validity

if you accept the premises, the conclusions necessarily follow

## validity

- **definition** - an argument is valid if and only of denying its conclusions is incompatible with accepting all its premises
    - only arguments and inferences can be valid/invalid
    - validity is not a property of statements 

- sentences do not have the properties of validity/invalidity
- not about plausibility or truth

### example

logically valid arguments:

- if the moon is made of green cheese, then pigs fly. the moon is made of green cheese. hence, pigs fly - $a \implies b, a \equiv true \equiv b$
- there are chairs and tables in this room. therefore there are chairs in this room - $(a\land b) \equiv true \equiv a$
- there are chairs in this room. thus, there are chairs in this room - $a \implies a$

not a logical argument:

- there is a tremendous amount of evidence for human caused climate change. if climate change is human caused, then we ought to take action. so, we should take action
    - strong inductive argument
    - not a deductively valid argument

## validity and enthymemes

- all invalid arguments can be constructed as valid enthymemes


- this course has 5 TAs
- therefore, i am an amazing genius

- unstated premise
    - if this course has 5 TAs then I am an amazing genius 

## soundness

- **soundness** - an argument thats valid and all its premises are true

## arguments

```
inductive   deductive
_____________________
strong      valid    | good structure
weak        invalid  | bad structure
cogent      sound    | true premises
```


## abstraction


- **abstraction** - a process by which we take away features or details of a thing in order to focus on details of greater importance

to abstract statements and arguments, we represent them symbolically

## argument forms

arguments can be recast abstractly as argument forms

- if its raining the sidewalk is wet

-

## formal validity

- An argument is
formally valid if it has a valid
argument form; and an argument form is valid if
an only if there is no argument of that form which
has all true premises and a false conclusion
