# logic applied to the world

one of the difficulties that arieses when studying logic is that we are all convinced that we are logical - that we can be logical when we need to be 

"Good sense is the best distributed thing in the world: for everyone thinks himself so well endowed with it that even those who are hardest to please in everything else do not desire more of it than they posses." - descartes

we should not be easily pleased by our own skill in reasoning

## what is logic?

- **logic** - principles or guidelines for good reasoning
    - the study of what makes claims, beliefs, or ideas follow from other claims beliefs, or ideas
    - **informal logic** - non formal standards, criteria , procedures for the analysis, interpretation evaluation, criticism, and construction of reason 
        - critical thinking
        - fallacy theory - not as authoritative as people think
            - particular assumption sets will make fallacies more or less relevant
    - **formal logic** - and abstract study of reasoning


## informal reasoning example
    
- probabilistic

```
almost everyday Anne takes a nap at 4pm
its 4:15pm
so, Anne is likely resting
```

## formal reasoning example

formal as in form, structure

```
if its a clear dat, then we should go the beach
its a clear day
ok, we should got the the beach
```

TODO

## symbolic logic

- arugument forms are abstract

## logic and philosophy 

## artificiality

- looses the subtlety of language

## power

## elegance
