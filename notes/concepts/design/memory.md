## types of memory

### sensory memory

a small buffer for retaining some information after a stimuli is over

- visual - iconic memory - very short
- audio - echoic memory - a few seconds
- touch - haptic memory - ~2 seconds

### short term memory (working memory)

temporary storage for recall

- rapid access (~70ms)
- rapid decay (~200ms)
- ~7 chunks (meaningful combination of items) of memory
    - chunking data is important for remembering more information
- interference disturbs short-term emory retention
    - tasks held in short-term memory cause a desire to complete the tasks as soon as possible

## attention

information is passed from sensory memory to short-term memory through attention

affected by need, interest, ect.
