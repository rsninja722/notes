# user centered design

- you are (usually) not the user
- design is an iterative process

## differences between designer and user

- perceptual, motor, and cognitive capacity
- domain knowledge

## principles

- design should be influenced by technology and users
- focus should be on users from the beginning
- users are consulted throughout the design process, their feedback being considered in the design

## process

1. investigate
2. ideate
3. prototype
4. evaluate previous steps, go back to any as needed
5. produce
