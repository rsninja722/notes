# perception and vision

## gestalt principles of perception

### proximity

- close object belong together
- cleaner way of organizing elements

### similarity

- items with similar visual characteristics belong together
- repetition in design
    - helps users recognize patterns in meaning
- can be broken to distinguish elements (contrast)

### continuity

- items arranged in space in lines/curves are perceived to belong together

### closure

- humans tend to complete figures perceptually when parts of information are missing
- use of visual elements to "contain" other elements
    - example: the design of scroll bars causes them to be perceived as the thumb being within the track, instead of a thumb and a box below and above

### area (figure and ground)

### symmetry

- symmetrical (often unconnected) elements are integrated into one coherent object
- we simplify complex forms into simple shapes
