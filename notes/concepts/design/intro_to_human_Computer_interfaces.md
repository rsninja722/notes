# intro to Human Computer Interfaces

- goals
    - understand why bad design is so prevalent
    - learn and practice methods for good design
    - understand how to plan, build, and evaluate interfaces



for an example of a bad human computer interface see [https://userinyerface.com/](https://userinyerface.com/)

- **human computer interaction (HCI)** - discipline concerned with design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them

- **design** - process of creating or shaping tools or artifacts for direct human use

- **interface** - method of enabling a person to interact with a system
    - software, hardware, physical object

- bad design can lead to confusing users resulting in misuse of computing systems, or preventing use in the first place

- **communication challenge** - when the idea for a project goes from person to person, any lack of clear communication creates unwanted results

- designing for diverse users
    - frequent users that are experienced with an interface, may enjoy a different interface than a new user
    - allowing customization is important in design

- **good interfaces** - some criteria for a good interface:
    - users feel satisfied
    - users can complete tasks without error
    - users can quickly complete their task
    - users can quickly learn how to use the system, and learn all its functions

- **art vs design** - design is concerned with the creation of something useful and usable, art does not have these restrictions

- **interface** - what is presented to the user
- **interaction** - the dialogue between the computer and user

## core design skills 

- take a broad view, see constraints, understand what could make a difference
- frame or reframe the problem and objective
- creating/envisioning many options,and choosing a good approach from those
- visualize and prototype the intended solution

## interactive cycle 

- **interactive cycle** - `user --articulation-> input --performance-> computer --presentation-> output --observation-> user`
    - **articulation** - the user performing some action to perform a task
    - **performance** - the computer does something (not necessarily visible to the user)
    - **presentation** - the computer conveying the task performed
    - **observation** - user interpreting computer output to decide on the next input
    - input,output - the interface

- **gulf of execution** - users need to translate plans to input the system can understand
    - to mitigate - minimize translation needed by making inputs easy to understand and use
- **gulf of evaluation** - user needs to interpret computer output 
    - to mitigate - know what the user expects, and provide that information in a way that is easy to get and easy to interpret
