## seven stages of action

for every stage of using a product, the following seven questions should be answerable

1. What do I want to accomplish?
2. What are the alternative action sequences?
3. What action can I do now?
4. How do I do it?
5. What happened?
6. What does it mean?
7. Is this okay? Have I accomplished my goal?

to ensure these questions are answerable, the following principles should be followed. note: there is not a one-to-one mapping between the questions and principles, but if you follow all of them, all questions can be answered.

## seven fundamental principles of design

- **Discoverability** - User can determine: 1. possible actions and 2. current state of device
- **Feedback** - full and continuous info about action results and new state of product/service
- **Conceptual model** - design projects info for a user to create an accurate conceptual model of the system
    - enhances understanding, feeling of control, discoverability, and evaluation of results
- **Affordances** - the possible actions the user perceives align with the action the user desires
- **Signifiers** - visual cues (signifiers) are used to enhance discoverability, and feedback
- **Mappings** - relationship between controls and their actions are enhanced by closeness in both space and time
- **Constraints** - use of restrictions/constraints to guide user behavior and ease interpretation
    - constraints can be physical, logical, semantic, or cultural
    - examples - validating and email in an online form instead of letting any text be submitted
