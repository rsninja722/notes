# history of machine learning

- starts with [history of computation](?note=notes/concepts/engineering/history_of_computation.md)

- john von neumann
    - conceived the modern computer architecture
    - introduced ideas about automata and nero science with computation
    - invented game theory
- the golden age
    - first summer of AI
        - 1955 - john mccarthy (creator of lisp) coined the name "artificial intelligence"
        - lots of optimism for quick easy progress
        - frank rosenblatt implements the first perception
    - 1958 - article in the new york times - "electronic 'brain' teaches itself"
        - predicted facial recognition, OCR, and voice recognition
    - 1964 - ELIZA - first chat bot
    - 1968 - simulated environments - micro world that a computer can manipulate and answer questions about
- first winter 70s to 80s
    - minsky shows that 1 layer perceptrons will not work
    - lighthill report (1972) discredits AI research due to combinatorial explosion (example: go game has $250^200$ possible games)
    - AI funding is cut
    - AI is thought of as unscientific as alchemy
    - first winter thought to be caused by attempting to create general AI instead of targeting specific tasks
- second AI summer 80s to 90s
    - instead of AI, called expert systems
    - systems being built based on mathematical logic
- second AI winter
    - hard to codify all knowledge
    - often knowledge is contradictory
    - experts often don't write down logical rules for why they do things
- third summer of AI 90s
    - behavioral AI, agent based AI
    - releasing autonomous systems into the real world (example: roomba, deep blue beats garry kasparov in chess)
- third AI winter 90s to 2006
    - no new applications of AI found
- summer of deep learning
    - 2006 geoffrey hinton - publishes a paper about deep learning
- 2012 - alexnet wins image recognition contest
- 2017 - attention is all you need (transformers paper)
