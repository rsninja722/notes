# algorithms

- **algorithm** - a procedure for solving problems, describing a finite, deterministic, and effective problem solving method suitable for implementation as a computer program
    - can be encoded in natural langue, pseudo-code, or computer language
    - "effective" meaning there is a computer on which the algorithm can be ran
    - space and time complexity are the most important aspects of algorithm design

- **big O notation** - a theoretical measure of how quickly the required space and time for an algorithm to run increase as the size of input increases
    - O stands for Order of growth/approximation

- **pseudocode** - middle ground between natural language and computer language where language specific details and syntax are omitted
