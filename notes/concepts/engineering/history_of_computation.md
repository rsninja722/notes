# history of computation

- **computer** - given some input, an output is produced that represents some useful data
- even before computers existed, many mathematicians and philosophers were trying to create various models of computation, many of which were computationally equivalent

## history

- **300 bce**
    - eculid came up with algorithms for finding GCD
    - one of the first computational problems - trisect an angle, aka create 3 equal angles (using compass and a straight edge)? - not possible 
    - another question - create a cube with double the volume of the other (using compass and a straight edge)
- **800's ce**
    - al-khawrazmi came up with algebra and arithmetic
- **1500's** 
    - cubic equation
- **1800's**
    - abel-ruffini - proved that degree 5 polynomials dont generally have a solution that can be represented by radicals
    - galois - $x^5-x-1 = 0$ has no radical solutions
        - peire wantzel showed that the angle and cube questions from 300 bce are impossible
    - newtons principia mathematical - solving polynomial equations
    - gauss - disquisitions arithmatica - FFT
- **1820**
    - charles babbage built a mechanical computer called the "difference engine" which would tabulate polynomial functions
- **1837** - charles babbage describes the "analytical engine" (was computationally universal)
- **1840** - jaquard loom created that used punch cards to implement a weaving pattern
- **1842-43** - ada lovelace created the first computer program when translating an article about the analytical engine, going beyond babbage's programs that only considered the possibilities of mathematical computation
- **1900's**
    - hilbert russell - formalist school - reduce math to formal manipulation of symbols    
    - kurt godel - incompleteness theorem - no matter what system of number theory you take, there are statements that are "true" but cannot be proven
- **1901** - a 100bc analogue computer called a "Antikythera mechanism" was found that shows positions of stellar objects and predicts eclipses
- **1920s** - alonzo church develops lambda calculus
- **1936** - alan turing develops a model of computation "automatic machines" later named "turing machines"

## functional vs procedural

throughout history, we see the rise of functional programming through calculus, godels incompleteness theory, and alonzo church's lambda calculus. we also see the rise of procedural programming through babbage's analytical engine, ada lovelace's program, and turing machines
