# computer graphics

computer graphics is a broad felid that has many areas:

- computational geometry
- rendering
- character animation
- simulation
- visualization
- vision

computer graphics has many applications

- games
- movies / media
- industrial design (CAD)
- medical diagnostics
- geographic information systems / self driving
- virtual reality / augmented reality
- digital humans
- fabrication (3d printing)

## computation requirements

different applications can use computational resources differently, movies can be rendered ahead of time, but games need to be rendered in real time and require a minimum amount to resources to run smoothly
