# state and evaluation

- **state** - a list of variables with associated values. (ex. in the state consisting of (x,5 and (y,6), variable x is associated with the value 5 and variable y is associated with the value 6)
- **evaluation** - the process of replacing all variables in an expression with their associated values, and evaluating the resulting expression. for example:
    - $x - y + 2$ &emsp; state: {(x, 5), (y, 6)}
    - $5 - 6 + 2$ &emsp; replace variables with values
    - $1$ &emsp; evaluate expression
