execution of an assignment statement changes the state


## multiple assignment

$x_1, x_2, \dots , x_n \coloneqq E_1, E_2, \dots , E_n$ - assign the value of the expressions to the variables, matching the order

note: all expressions are evaluated before any assignment

note: $(x,y \coloneqq x+y,x+y) \ne (x \coloneqq x+y; y \coloneqq x+y)$
