# human computer interaction

- focus: why is design hard

## human computer interaction design

- goal: design products/systems that are useful and usable to all target users, and leverage people's existing understanding and skills to minimize learning and translation
- design around interaction has shifted from prioritizing computer speed and easy to attempting to naturally suit user's tasks

## ubiquitous computing (ubicomp)

- when technologies weave themselves into everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it
- active research area
- goal: create a language of interaction so close to what people already want to do that users don't notice they are using it

### ubicomp design method

- **context** - system takes into account the user location, emotional state, ect.
- **broader i/o** - sensors, form factor, computers are embedded in the physical interface
- **adding intelligence** - make systems more situationally appropriate, help users

- **ultimate goal** - interfaces should support tasks the user wants to perform
    - users shouldn't have to adapt their behavior/learn new interaction techniques


## designer bias

- a designer, must be aware in the theirs differences in skills and domain knowledge compared to potential users

## designer's fallacy

- a designer can design into a technology, its purpose and uses

- reality: there is no such control
- to get close to that ideal - understand people and how they already use the technology or similar technologies

### why is design hard

- we aren't the people using the system
- we can't anticipate how people will use it
- predicting which designs will be successful is difficult
- design involves making trade-offs
- good designs are not usually obvious
