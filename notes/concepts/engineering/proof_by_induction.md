# proof by induction

Let $S(n), n = 1, 2, 3, ... ,$ be a sequence of statements indexed by positive integers $n$.
 
Suppose we can verify these two claims:

- base case: $S(1)$ is true.
- induction step: For each $n$, the truth of $S(n)$ implies the truth of $S(n + 1)$.

Then it follows that $S(n)$ is true for all positive integers $n = 1, 2, 3, . . .$
