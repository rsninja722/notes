# enumerative combinatorics

## general multiplication principle

- to find the total number of possible outcomes for a situation, multiply the number of possible choices at each step
    - $\text{possible outcomes} = \text{choices}_1 \cdot \text{choices}_2 \cdot ... \cdot \text{choices}_n$ 
- if there are restrictions on choices then: $\text{possible outcomes} = \text{all outcomes} - \text{outcomes with restricted choice(s)}$

this principle is used to derive various counting formulas
