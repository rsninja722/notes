# independence

- two events are **independent** if $P(AB) = P(A)P(B)$ (within the same sample space)
    - extends to n independent events - $P(ABC) = P(A)P(B)P(C)$ and AB, AC, CB must also be independent
- if $A$ and $B$ are independent, then so are $A^c$ and $B$, $A$ and $B^c$, $A^c$ and $B^c$
