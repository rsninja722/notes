# computer components

computers can:

- take input
- process data
- store/retrieve data
- output data

internal components:

- **Motherboard** - connects all components
    - **bridges** - microprocessors on the motherboard that handle device IO
- **Central Processing Unit** - processes information and runs main computations, acts as the brain of the computer
- **Random Access Memory** - volatile but quick access memory for storing data that only needs to be stored while the computer is on
- **Graphics Processing Unit** - often a separate card that plugs into the motherboard, able to run many simple computations in parallel and output to graphical displays
- **Hard Drive Disk/Solid State Drive** - non-volatile (permanent) storage for data that needs to persist even if the computer shuts down
- **Power Supply Unit** - regulates power and provides different voltages for components in the computer

external components:

- input
    - **punch card reader** - input device used by early computers to read programs and data
    - **keyboard** - used to input text characters into the computer
    - **mouse/track pad** - used to input a 2d vector at a specific polling rate as well as button and vertical scrolling input, usually to control a cursor
    - **scanner** - used to input digital copies of physical documents/pictures
    - **microphone** - used to input audio
    - **tablet** - used to input an absolute 2d coordinate, as well as value for pen pressure
    - **
- output
    - **printer** - used to output text and images on physical paper
    - **screen** - used to digitally display graphics
    - **speakers/headphones** - used to output audio
- storage
    - **external HDD/SSD** - HDD/SSD designed to temporarily connect to a computer for data transfer, and then be stored else where
    - **USB Drive** - small SSD used to store and physically transfer files in a local area
