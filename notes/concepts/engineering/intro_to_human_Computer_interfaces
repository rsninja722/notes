# intro to Human Computer Interfaces

- goals
    - understand why bad design is so prevalent
    - learn and practice methods for good design
    - understand how to plan, build, and evaluate interfaces

- **human computer interaction (HCI)** - discipline concerned with design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them

- **interface** - method of enabling a person to interact with a system
    - software, hardware, physical object

- bad design can lead to confusing users resulting in misuse of computing systems, or preventing use in the first place

- **communication challenge** - when the idea for a project goes from person to person, any lack of clear communication creates unwanted results
