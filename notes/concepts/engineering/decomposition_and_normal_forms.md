# decomposition and normal forms

- **decomposition** - a decomposition of a relational schema R consists of replacing R by multiple relational schemas, each over a subset of the attributes of R.

## normal forms


more restrictive as you go down

- **First Normal Form** (1NF)
- **Second Normal Form** (2NF) - functional dependencies
- **Third Normal Form** (3NF) - functional dependencies
- **Boyce-Codd Normal Form** (BCNF) - functional dependencies
- **Fourth Normal Form** (4NF) - multivalued dependencies
- **Fifth Normal Form** (5NF) - join dependencies
