# conditional probability

- $P(A | B) = \frac{P(AB)}{P(B)}$ - the conditional probability of A given B
    - can be rearranged - $P(AB) = P(A) P(B | A)$
    - generalizes to n events - $P(ABC) = P(A) P(B | A) P(C | AB)$
- **partition** - finite collection of events that are pairwise disjoint and make up $\Omega$
