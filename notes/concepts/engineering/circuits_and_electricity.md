## electricity recap

- basis for all digital computers
- underlying principles
    - charge and electric potential/voltage
    - current
    - resistance
    - electromagnetic waves
- ohms law $R = \frac{V}{I}$
- current is the flow of electrons
 
- if you have 2 resistors in parallel the current is the same
- of you have 2 parallel resistors, the voltage is the same

## transistors

MOSFET transistor

- s - source
- g - gate - doped silicon
- d - drain
- b - base

current goes from source, across the gate, and out the drain

TODO put in on/off transistor diagrams
