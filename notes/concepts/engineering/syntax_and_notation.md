# syntax and notation

syntax of conventional mathematical expressions:

- **constant** - unchanging value (ex. 1, 7456, 3.141592)
- **variable** - symbol representing a value that can change (ex. $x, y, E, \delta$)
- **name** - finite sequence of characters used to identify an object
- **operator** - a symbol representing a process in which a number, quantity, expression, etc., is altered or manipulated according to formal rules. there are 3 types of operations:
    - unary operations (ex. $-5$)
    - binary operations (ex. $1+2, 4\times 6 - 8$)
    - ternary operations (ex. $a ? b : c$)

notation is used to represent these parts of an expression. for example:

- $12$ is used to denote the concept of 12 things (constant)
- $x$ is used to denote the concept of a variable that has an assigned value

notation has tools to denote how an expression should be analyzed. example: **commas** to separate context. or **brackets** to define the order of analysis. The atomic expression $(E)$ denotes that we isolate expression $E$ for analysis no matter what is outside the brackets.

the expression $a \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c$ is only true if the definitions of the notation and syntax are defined in a certain way. if $\cdot$ represented a variable instead of multiplication, the expression would be false. We tend to only focus on the meaning of an expression, not the notation/syntax

- **expression** - a collection of notations that together express a quantity (ex. $E, (E), 1+2, (3 + x)^2$)
