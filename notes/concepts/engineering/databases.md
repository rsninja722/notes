# databases

- **database** - large collection of data with a clear structure that provides ways to access/modify it
    - **entities** - things represented by data
    - **relationships** - meaningful associations between entities
- **data** - collection of values that convey information
- **DBMS (database management system)** - software to create and manage databases
    - benefits:
        - data independence (how data is used is different from how its represented and stored)
        - high level query language
            - lets you specify what information you want, not how to get it
        - guarantees in data integrity and recovery
        - concurrent access
        - efficient with large data volumes
