# credit and debit management

### types of credit

TODO

### loan contracts

1. insurance agreement clause
    - credit life insurance will pay the loan off in the event that the borrower dies
2. acceleration clause
    - if one payment is missed, the entire loan comes due immediately
3. deficiency payments clause
    - allows lender to recover cost of collecting the money on a defaulted loan
4. recourse clause - lets leander get a cut of the borrower's wage (garnish)

- in the US, borrowers can "walk away" from a loan, leaving the bank with the asset. possible since their is no recourse clause

- co-signing a loan
    - if the borrower does not qualify for a loan, another party can "co-sign" giving the other party responsibility to pay of the loan if the borrower doesn't

### debt capacity

- lenders look at:
    - ability to pay the debt with current income
    - credit score

- **gross debt service ratio (GDS)** = (mortgage + related payments) / gross family income
    - percent of income that will cover housing cost
- **total debt service ratio (TDS)** = (annual mortgage + related payments + property tax + other debt payments) / gross family income


#### example

Family Annual Gross Income = $100,000, monthly mortgage payment = $2,000, Property taxes = $3,000 per year, heating costs= $1200 per year, monthly car lease payment =$300, monthly credit card payment = $120

!be consistent with annual/monthly



GDS ratio = (2000x12 + 3000 + 1200) / (100000) = 28.2%

TDS ratio = (2000x12 + 3000 + 1200 + 300x12 + 120x12) / (100000) = 33.24%

---|---|---|---|---|---
bank a | 10% | 0 | 200 | 200 | $200/2000 = 10$%
bank b | 8% | 100 | 160 | 260 | $260/2000 = 13$%
