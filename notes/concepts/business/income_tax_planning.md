# income tax planning

in general - high income spouse should pay expenses, low income spouse should do the investing

- common law and legally married considered the same for tax purposes

- non-productive foreign assets are not taxed

- losses can be applied to gains 3 years previously, and forwards indefinitely

- cash back not reportable

- taxable income = total income - deductions
    - then use tax credits to "pay the tax" on the federal taxable income

- gst tax credit is the only refundable tax credit


- **tax savings** = tax rate $\cdot \Delta$ expenses

## average vs marginal

marginal rate = $\Delta$ taxes / $\Delta$ income

average rate = total taxes / total income

## deductions vs tax credits

- deductions subtract from taxable income
- tax credits subtract from tax owed

### common deductions

- RRSP contributions
- Registered Pension Plan

## attribution rules

- "splitting" income with spouse reduces total tax owed because of progressive system

- to prevent this, CRA implements **attribution rules** - applies to money transferred to spouse or child under 18.
    - investment income earned on the amount transferred will be taxed in the hands of the taxpayer.
    - for capital gains, attribution rules apply to spouse,but not for minors 

## spousal RRSP

tax break is received by the high earner contributing to the spouse's RRSP

withdrawals are taxed in the hands of the recipients

## pension splitting

up to 50% of CPP/QPP benefits can be directed to spouse provided both are older than 60
