depreciable cost = asset's cost - estimated residual value

straight line depreciation per year = $\frac{\text{cost } - \text{ residual value}}{\text{useful life in years}}

- **impaired asset** - when carrying amount > recoverable amount
    - **impairment loss** = carrying amount - recoverable amount
    - **recoverable amount** - max(asset's fair value, value in use)
        - **fair value** - estimate of price that reasonable buyers and sellers would agree on under current market conditions (cost to sell if negative)
        - **value in use** - present estimate of cash flow expected to be earned by using the asset
