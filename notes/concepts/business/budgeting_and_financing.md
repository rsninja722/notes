# budgeting and financing

## notes

- use market value if possible, if necessary, use historical price

## financial planning process

1. analyze current financial position
2. develop short and long term goals
    - goals must be concrete and realistic
3. identify and evaluate plan to achieve goal
4. implement plan
5. get feedback, monitor and revise plan

## balance sheet

assets | financing
---|---
|

- **assets** = debt + equity
- **net worth (equity)** = assets - debt

### examples

assets | financing
---|---
house = $100k | mortgage = $95k
| down payment = $5k

net worth = $100k - $95k = $5k

___

owning cash

assets | financing
---|---
cash = $2k | equity = $2k

then purchase a computer

assets | financing
---|---
computer = $2k | equity = $2k


## financing

2 ways to pay for assets:

1. debt - borrowing money, owing scheduled payments
    - aka. mortgage,loan,credit (card) balance
2. equity - using personal funds

## hiring a financial planning professional

consider:

1. education - B. Com, BBA, MBA ...
2. certification - CFP (certified financial planning), CPA for tax, CFA for investment ...
3. experience
4. reputation

- also consider how much time you want to spend - do you want control, or do you want someone to do everything for you

- be aware of people trying to take advantage of you 
    -example: open houses benefit agent not owner

### how are planners paid?

evaluate advice by being aware of how planners get money

1. salaried employees providing "free" advice - more focused on selling certain products, not necessarily on your personal needs
2. commission planners - gain a cut of the sale if they get you to buy a certain product
3. fee-only planners - paid directly by clients

- certain industries do or do not require disclosure, be aware

## cashflow statement

- a history of income and expenditures

- inflow - paycheck, interest, ...
- outflow - food, rent, utils, bills, debt payments, ...

inflow should cover outflow

### complications

- pension contributions - outflow, but turns into an asset
- mortgage payments - outflow - decreases debt
- unrealized gains/losses - TODO

## budget

- a projection of cash inflows and outflows by category
- purpose - control spending, check liquidity, planning

### psychology of budgeting

less about finance, more about behavioral change

1. avoid pain or regret - personal finance decisions are painful decisions
2. pay yourself first - limit spending
3. mental accounting - allot set amounts for certain spending catagories ahead of time
