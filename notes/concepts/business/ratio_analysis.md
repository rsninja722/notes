# ratio analysis

- part of fundamental analysis
- a quantitative method of gaining insight into a company's liquidity, operational efficiency, and profitability

## use

- **across time** - ratios can be used to track a company's performance across time by comparing its previous statements
- **across companies** - multiple companies' statements can be compared using ratio analysis 
- **benchmarks** - companies can set ratio targets to reach, lending institutions will often set benchmarks for companies

## ability to pay current liabilities

### current ratio

Measures ability to pay current liabilities with current assets

$$\frac{\text{current assets}}{\text{current liabilities}}$$

### quick ratio (acid-test ratio)

Shows ability to pay all current liabilities if they come due immediately

$$\frac{\text{cash} + \text{short-term investments} + \text{net current receivables}}{\text{current liabilities}}$$

## turnover and cash conversion

### inventor turnover / days' inventory outstanding (DIO)

Indicates saleability of inventory - the number of times a company sells its average level of inventory during a year

$$\text{inventory turnover} = \frac{\text{cost of goods sold}}{\text{average inventory}}$$

- average inventory = (beginning + end) /2

$$\text{DIO} = \frac{\text{365}}{\text{inventory turnover}}$$

### accounts receivable turnover

Measures ability to receive cash from credit customers

$$\frac{\text{net credit sales}}{\text{average net accounts receivable}}$$

### days' sales in receivables / days' sales outstanding (DSO)

Shows how many days' sales remain in Accounts Receivable - how many days it takes to collect the average level of receivables

$$\text{days sales in receivables} = \frac{\text{average net accounts receivable}}{\text{average daily sales}}$$

$$\text{DSO} = \frac{\text{365}}{\text{accounts receivable turnover}}$$

### accounts payable turnover / days' payable outstanding (DPO)

Shows how many times a year accounts payable turn over, and how many days it takes the company to pay off accounts payable

$$\text{accounts payable turnover} = \frac{\text{cost of goods sold}}{\text{average accounts payable}}$$

$$\text{DPO} = \frac{\text{365}}{\text{accounts payable turnover}}$$

### cash cycle conversion

Shows overall liquidity by computing the total days it takes to convert inventory to receivables and back to cash, minus the days to pay off creditors

$$\text{cash cycle conversion} = \text{DIO} + \text{DSO} - \text{DPO}$$

## ability to pay long-term debt

### debt ratio

Indicates percentage of assets financed with debt

$$\frac{\text{total liabilities}}{\text{total assets}}$$

### times-interest-earned ratio

Measures the number of times operating income can cover interest expense

$$\frac{\text{income from operations}}{\text{income expense}}$$

## measuring profitability

### gross profit percent

Shows the percentage of profit that a company makes from merely selling the product, before any other operating costs are subtracted

$$\frac{\text{gross profit}}{\text{net sales}}$$

### operating income percent

Shows the percentage of profit earned from each dollar in the company's core business, after operating costs have been subtracted

$$\frac{\text{income from operations}}{\text{net sales}}$$

### return on net sales

Shows the percentage of each sales dollar earned as net income

$$\frac{\text{net income}}{\text{net sales}}$$

### asset turnover

Measures the amount of net sales generated for each dollar invested in assets

$$\frac{\text{net sales}}{\text{average total assets}}$$

### return on total assets

Measures how profitably a company uses its assets

$$\frac{\text{net income}}{\text{average total assets}}$$

### leverage ratio / equity multiplier

Measures the ratio of average total assets to average common shareholders' equity

$$\frac{\text{average total assets}}{\text{average common shareholders' equity}}$$

### return on common shareholder's equity

Measures how much income is earned for every dollar invested by the company's common shareholders

$$\frac{\text{net income} - \text{preferred dividend}}{\text{average common shareholders' equity}}$$

### earnings per share of common stock

Measures the amount of net income earned for each share of the company's common stock outstanding

$$\frac{\text{net income} - \text{preferred dividend}}{\text{average number of common shares outstanding}}$$

## analyzing shares as an investment

### price/earnings ratio

Indicates the market price of $1 of earnings

$$\frac{\text{market price per common share}}{\text{earnings per share}}$$

### dividend yield

Shows the percentage of a stock's market value returned as dividends to stockholders each period

$$\frac{\text{dividend per share of common stock}}{\text{market price per share of common stock}}$$

### book value per share of common stock

Indicates the recorded accounting amount for each share of common stock outstanding

$$\frac{\text{total shareholders' equity} - \text{preferred equity}}{\text{number of shares of common stock outstanding}}$$
