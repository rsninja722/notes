# inventory and cost of goods

To calculate the cost of goods sold, we need the following equations
Cost of goods purchased = purchases - purchase returns and allowances - purchase discount + freight-in

Cost of goods available for sale = cost of goods purchased + beginning inventory

Ending inventory = beginning inventory + cost of goods purchased - cost of goods of sold

Cost of goods sold = beginning inventory +  cost of goods purchased - ending inventory


cgafs = cogs + ei
cogs = cgafs - ei
cogs = bi + purchases - ei

FOB shipping point - buyer owns in transit
FOB destination - seller owns in transit

gross profit = sales - cogs

gross profit % = GP/sales 
gross profit = sales * GP%

estimated cogs = sales - estimated GP
estimated cogs = sales - sales * GP%
estimated inventory = begin inv + purchase - estimated cogs

Double Diminishing Balance

ddb = (years,cost,dep,residual) => Math.min((1/years * 2) * (cost-dep), cost-dep-residual)
