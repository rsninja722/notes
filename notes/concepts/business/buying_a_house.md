# buying a house and mortgage financing

## example

mortgage = 350000

k = 6.5%

years = 26

payment/period = ~28500

payment schedule

year 1 - interest: ~27000 principle: ~1500

...

year 26 - interest: ~1500 principle: ~27000

## renting vs ownership

## down payments

- minimums
    - \\$500000 or less - 5% of purchase price
    - \\$500000 to \\$999999 - 5% of first \\$500000 of purchase price, and 10% of remaining portion
    - \\$1000000 or more - 20% of purchase price

## loan to value (LTV)

- **LTV** = loan / asset price

## mortgage insurance

- 20% down payment needed to avoid mortgage insurance
- otherwise: pay a premium based on the amount the bank is paying for, and the total cost

### example rates

coverage up to 95% of asset value (95% LTV) - premium on total loan = 4%

up to 65% (65% LTV) - 0.6$ premium

## financing with registered accounts

- RRSP - borrow up to \\$60000 from RRSP without tax consequence under home buyer's plan (HBP)
    - cannot have owned a house in the last 5 years
    - mush be repaid within 15 years
- FHSA - can contribute \\$8000 yearly, max of \\$40000
    - tax-deductible
    - tax-free for withdrawals for a house
    - can be withdrawn for other purposes as taxable income 
    - contribution room is carried forward as long as an account has been opened

## buying process

- pre-qualifying - get assessed for how much you can afford
- decide: existing house vs new - harder to get the bank to commit to a loan while house is being built
    - builders often cannot get funding until ~70% of units are presold
- mortgages - rates are negotiable
    - open vs. closed - TODO
    - mortgage brokers - third party service that gives access to many lenders, theoretically offer the best rate
        - paid by lender by commission - brokers tend to consolidate to a few lenders for higher commission

## new vs existing house

- existing
    - real estate agent
    - inspector
    - lawyer
        - does a title search for the land register to ensure you are buying from the owner, and to see unpaid property tax/mortgages
- new house
    - lawyer
    - no need for inspector due to warranty
    - interior customization available for inflated price - hire for the work yourself for a better price


## title insurance

- covers potential mistakes made by the lawyer (missed leans)
