# family planning and law

## household budgeting

- financial compatibility is important in relationships
- look at short and long term goals and agree on saving/spending amounts
- give each other financial space - allocate amount for each to spend freely
- let both people contribute to balancing the cheque book to gain perspective

## family law

- how is a couple defined?
    - federal divorce act 
    - provincial family law act (FLA)
    - income tax act (ITA)
- what qualifies as a **spousal couple (common law)**? - two persons who live in conjugal relationship, the divorce act does not apply
    - ITA - two people who live together for at least a year or less than a year if the union has produced a child
    - FLA - tow people who have cohabited continuously for at least 3 years, or who are in a relationship of some permanence and have one or more children

### divorce

- grounds for divorce
    - internal separation for one year because of marital difficulties
    - adultery
    - husband or wife subjects the other to intolerable physical or mental cruelty
- asset division upon divorce - assets are split the same regardless of cause (no fault)

- **division of property** (governed by FLA) - actual ownership doesn't matter, all assets are divided
    - under the FLA, the property acquired during the marriage is to be divided fairly
    - accounting of property acquired during the marriage - market value of assets each party owned or jointly owned - cost of disposition
    - matrimonial home - regardless of how a house house is brought into a marriage, and the married couple lives it it, it becomes part of the assets to be divided up
    - exclusions
        - property owned prior to the marriage
        - inheritance
        - personal items such as clothing
        - proceeds from life insurance policy
- **common law/unmarried spouses** - governed by provincial rule
    - in ontario - divisions do not apply, legal owners keep the assets
    - not under FLA - so claims to ownership need to be proven manually

- marriage contract/cohabitation agreement (prenuptial) - a private contract that can override the FLA

- **support**
    - **dependant children**
        - definition of child - a person whom a parent has demonstrated a settled intention to treat as a child of their family
            - includes children from previous marriage
        - every parent has an obligation to provide support for unmarried dependent children under 18 or who are attending educational institution full time. children with disabilities may require support for life.
        - amount to be payed is determined by guidelines under both divorce act and FLA
        - under the ITA, the child support received is not taxable (doesn't have to be reported by the custodial spouse), the spouse who is paying the support cannot   deduct the payments they make from their tax report
    - **nature of spousal support**
        - compensatory spousal support addresses the economic disadvantages that flow from from the relationship or roles adopted during the relationship
        - non-compensatory spousal support addresses disparities between the needs of the parties and the ability to meet these needs following the dissolution of the relationship
    - how is **spousal support** amount determined?
        - spouse's ability to pay
        - intended to equalize the incomes of two spouses
        - relieve economic hardship  of the spouses arising from the breakdown of the relationship
        - promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse within a reasonable time, whenever practicable
        - amount determined allows for the income derived from the property divided between the spouses
        - the prudent investment of the assets from the division of property will be included in the calculations
        - the spouse's employment qualifications will be considered
        - acknowledge a spouse's contributions to the relationship
        - balance any economic advantage or disadvantage to a spouse resulting from ending of the relationship
