# economics foundations

Economics is the study of the choices consumers, business managers, and government officials make to attain their goals, given their scarce resources.

Economics is a social science because it applies the scientific method to the study of the interactions among individuals.
 

## definitions

- **models** - simplified versions of reality used to analyze real-world economic situations
    - development steps:
        1. decide on assumptions to use to develop the model
        2. formulate a testable hypothesis
        3. use economic data to test the hypothesis
        4. revise the model if it fails to explain the economic data well
        5. retain the model to answer similar questions in the future
    - assumptions - must me made for a model to be useful
        - usefulness can be measured by testing a hypothesis made based on assumption(s) in the real world
    - models with a proven hypothesis are referred to as *not rejected* rather than *accepted* since future data/analysis can always disprove them
- **economic variable** - measurable value about the economy that changes
    - hypotheses in a model are usually about a causal relationship between economic variables
- **positive analysis** - focused on hard facts
- **normative analysis** - value judgement about what is or could be is desirable or not
- **market** - group of buyers and sellers
    - **product markets** - markets for goods and services
    - **factor markets** - markets for the factors of production 
        - **factors of production** - inputs used to make goods and services
            - labor (physical and intellectual)
            - capital (tools, machines, buildings, other physical non-raw resources used to produce goods/provide services)
            - natural resources/land
            - entrepreneurs
    - protection of private/personal property - economists believe that for a market system to work well, private property must be protected so individuals are willing to take risk


### micro vs macro

- micro - individual agents and markets
    - individual behavior
    - production/efficiency of individual goods/services
    - impacts of central planning on specific markets
- macro - entire economy as a whole

## key economics ideas

- **people are rational** - does not mean participants always makes the best decision, just that participants use all information available in making decisions in the market
- **people respond to economic incentives** - participants consistently act according to economic opportunities, weighing choices based on their potential economic outcomes, intentionally or unintentionally 
- **optimal decisions are made at the margin**
    - extra benefit gained from a choice - **marginal benefit (MB)**
    - extra cost required resulting from a choice - **marginal cost (MC)**
        - when economists use the term cost, they often mean the personal cost for a participant, ignoring costs to a wider society/environment
    - the optimal economic decision is to continue an activity until **MC = MB**
    - **marginal analysis** - determining and comparing marginal costs and marginal benefits

## 3 fundamental ideas  

- What goods and services will be produced?
- How will the goods and services be produced?
- Who will receive the goods and services produced?

## economy types

- **centrally planned**
    - claimed advantages:
        - can reduce inequality through rationing
        - more efficient at allocating resources during emergencies
    - and disadvantages
        - production usually not efficient
        - hard to choose the right targets and ways to allocate resources
        - lack of innovation
        - historically underperforms market economies
- **pure market**
    - economists claim the following advantages
        - efficient resource allocation
        - fostering of innovation and entrepreneurship
        - freedom of choice
    - and the following disadvantages 
        - underproduction of some beneficial goods/services
        - inequality - resources not allocated efficiently with respect to consumption
- **mixed economy** - most economies are a mix of both
    - attempts to combine the advantages and reduce the disadvantages
    - most economists and policymakers prefer a mixed economy but disagree on the level of participation for private vs public

### efficiency, equity

- **productive efficiency** - how low of a cost a good/service is produced at
- **allocative efficiency** - how much production aligns with participants preferences'
    - not what everyone needs, but only as much as can be produced until the marginal cost meets the marginal benifit
- **voluntary exchange** - both the buyer and seller choosing to participate in a transaction because it benefits them both

- economists believe equitable systems don't incentivize productivity

### efficient market hypothesis

- markets tend to be efficient because they promote competition and voluntary exchange
- in efficient markets, price conveys information in the market

# trade-offs and comparative advantage

## definitions

- **economic growth** - increase in available physical capital

## opportunity cost

- **opportunity cost** the benefits that could be received from the next best alternative
    - each time a decision is made, a **trade-off** is made

## production possibilities

- production depends on available resources
- **production possibilities** - total quantity of goods and services an economy can produce
    - some resources have to be distributed across the production of multiple goods
    - production depends on labour and capital market

### production possibilities frontier

- the production possibilities for any opportunities $A$ and $B$:

![production frontier](./media/econ1.JPG)

- using all available resources puts one at the frontier (red line)
- all outputs of $A$ and $B$ in the opportunity set are possible with the current resource, any point beyond is not attainable


## absolute advantage

- **absolute advantage** - when one participant can produce more in total than another
- **comparative advantage** - when one participant has a lower opportunity cost of producing a good

- comparative advantage can exist without absolute advantage
- comparative advantage is the basis for specialization and trade
    - in general it is more economically efficient for participants to specialize in the production of goods they have a comparative advantage for

### example: allocating labour 

![lindsay and jordan labour ability](./media/econ2.JPG)

_ | lindsay | jordan
---|---|---
form OC | 5c = 6f, 1c = **1.2f** | 4c = 8f, 1c = 2f
customer OC | 6f = 5c, 1f = 0.833c | 8f = 4c, 1f = **0.5f**

we should assign people to the positions where they have the lowest opportunity cost
