guidelines

1. dont put limitations on what can be entered unless you have a specific goal
2. clarify what you are asking the user to fill in
    - informal - ask what they want to be called 
    - formal - ask what they want to be called formally
    - billing - ask the name as used by their bank
    - shipping - ask the name as used by the mail carrier
    - travel - ask the name as printed in their travel documents
3. have sensible defaults - prefill billing names with account information

there is no standard solution that works in all cases
