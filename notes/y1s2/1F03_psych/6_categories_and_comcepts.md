# categories and concepts

generalizing and sorting information that a person takes in. it is an ever-occurring, intuitive process 

## functions of categorization

explaining the rules of categorization is difficult

- **the illusion of the expert** - the feeling that a task must be simple for everyone because it is simple for oneself

we are all experts at categorization, but hardly anyone could explain it to a robot

### three basic functions of categorization

- **classification** - the ability to treat objects that appear different as belonging together
- **understanding** - the ability to evaluate a situation based on prior experience and act appropriately 
- **communication** - the ability to describe complex ideas or objects using a single label

## rules

if you are asked to write down the rules for defining what furniture is, it is harder then you may initially expect to create a reliable set of rules

the more general a category, the harder it is to define rules

rules don't sufficiently explain categorization

## prototype theory

- **prototype theory** - we categorize objects by comparing then to an internal "best" representation of a given category
- **prototype** - average or best member of a category
    - formed from the average representation of all personal experience
    - isn't necessarily something that exist in reality

new objects are categorized by being compared to existing prototypes

category members that are closer to a prototype are categorized more quickly

prototypes shift constantly

## exemplar theory

- **exemplar theory** - we categorize objects by comparing them to every perviously stored experience (exemplar) in a given category
- **exemplar** - a single perviously stored experience

category members that have more exemplars are categorized more quickly

## development of categorization

children as young as 3 can understand and generalize categories

children can understand hypothetical categorization, and the innate properties of a category

## animal categorization

basic categorization abilities exist in animals

### baboon example

baboons were trained to but objects into a food and non-food category, and could do so with 90% accuracy

they were also able to categorize same and different pairs of objects with 90% accuracy

## conclusions

categorization allows one to treat members of the same category similarly, and make predictions regarding new category members

categorization leads to being able to efficiently react to your current needs, but can also lead to stereotyping
