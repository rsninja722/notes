# science of leaning

## intro

learning by procrastinating and cramming leads to bad retention later on

efficient long term learning is key

### goals

[]()|[]()
---:|:---
where | understand distractions in your environment and how to proactively suppress them
when | understand why its more efficient to distribute studying over time and across multiple sessions
how | understand why practice testing and self-explanation are better than re-reading or copying notes
desirable difficulties | understand why strategies that initially slow down learning can actually be most efficient in the long run 

## where to study

### multitasking

the consensus in science is that people can't focus on multiple things at once 

multitasking is really just switching between tasks rapidly. there is a cost to the switching, so multitasking decreases performance

- **task switching** - when a person changes what they are doing/focused on. doing this rapidly is known as multitasking and results in less efficient work

#### Pomodoro technique 

designed to prevent task switching. involves 25 minutes of work followed by a 5-10 minute break. once repeated 3-4 times, a longer break should be taken.

goal is to have work periods without task switching, and use breaks to prevent burnout.

with this technique, instead of trying to not get distracted and go without checking you phone, going on social media, etc., you let yourself get distracted, but only every 25 minutes. the point is to schedule task switching instead of letting it be sporadic.


- **Pomodoro technique** - studying technique where time is spent studying for 25 minutes followed by a 5 minute break. used to prevent task switching

### conclusion

find a quite place to study that won't have people or things that could distract you. set devices to silent or disable social media apps when studying. find/create an environment that will help you study.

## when to study

Hermann Ebbinghaus in 1885 first studied how different schedules for learning affected retention

### the spacing effect 
he tried to memorize sets of random symbols. he tried to memorize them all in one day as well over multiple days. when spreading out the studying over multiple days, it took less total restudy attempts.

conclusion: the same amount of learning spread over multiple sessions is more effective for retention

spacing applies to other forms of learning not just memorization, example: improving at video games, practicing sports, leaning an instrument

spacing results in more learning per unit of time

- **spacing effect** - spreading out learning time in regular intervals over a longer period of time results in more effective learning then doing the same amount of learning in one session

## how to study

## ineffective methods 
- rereading
- highlighting
- verbatim note copying

this is because there is a lot of input, but not a lot of output

outputting information makes your brain process the information more the input resulting in better understanding and retention

these methods might seem effective because of
- short-term learning provided
- how intuitive or widespread the methods are
- makes us feel like we are learning since the material starts feeling familiar

## effective methods

### practice testing

by answering practice questions about material, about 15% more is learned compared to rereading review pages

- **retrieval practice effect** - by answering questions, you practice retrieving information from your brain. uses both input and output to learn

actively engaging with content improves the learning effectiveness

- **3x3 rule** - study until you have recalled the material at least 3 times during the initial study session. then recall the same material during 3 separate sessions after, with the sessions each 1 week apart

### blocked vs. interleaved practice

- **blocked practice** - learning a topic and doing practice questions for it 1 at a time
- **interleaved practice** - learning all topics and then doing all practice questions in a random order

## desirable difficulty

with the different studying techniques, some difficulty is desired, because techniques that are initially difficult have better long term results

studying strategies that help you learn at a deeper level often seem ineffective in the short term

## conclusion

1. use you time wisely
2. distribute your study sessions over time
3. focus on studying strategies that combine both input and output
