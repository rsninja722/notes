## attribution theories

### covariation theory

factors that affect disposition vs situation
- **consensus** - different people same situation. ask how do *others* behave in *this* situation?
    - high consensus if most people behave a certain way in the situation
    - low consensus if not many people behave a certain way in the situation
- **distinctiveness** - same people different situation. asks how do *they* behave in *other* situations?
    - high distinctiveness if they don't behave this way in other situations
    - low distinctiveness if they do behave this way in other situations
- **consistency** - same people same situation (at other times). ask how do they behave in this situation at other times
    - high consistency if they behave this way in this situation
    - low consistency if they don't usually behave this way in this situation

factor |high| low
---|---|---
consistency | situational or dispositional | wider situational
consensus | situational | dispositional
distinctiveness | situational | dispositional

### correspondent inference theory

- **degree of choice** - the amount of freedom the actor had in choosing their opinion or behavior
- **expectation** - the degree to which an individual's behavior in a particular social role matches our expectations for that role
    - typical behavior is less informative

## attribution errors

- **fundamental attribution error** - tendency to over-value dispositional factors for the observed behaviors of others while under valuing situational factors
- **actor observer effect** - consider the situational factors of your own behavior but the dispositional factors of others behaviors

the fundamental attribution error is not consistent across cultures. the fundamental attribution error is diminished in collectivist societies.
