# Problem Solving and Intelligence

# definitions of intelligence
psychologists can't agree on an operational definition


"Intelligence is whatever intelligence tests measure" - Edward Boring

or

- the ability to perform cognitive tasks
- learn from experience and adapt

or 

intelligence is the cognitive ability of an individual to learn from experience, reason well, rememberer important information, and cope with the demands of daily living.

# problem solving
 
## deductive/inductive reasoning

### deductive reasoning
from ideas and general information $$\to$$ specific conclusions

broad $$\to$$ specific

example: Micheal is a highly organized person that is specific on details. $$\therefore$$ we expect Micheal to have a spotless desk free of clutter

### inductive reasoning
from a general idea $$\to$$ specific facts

specific $$\to$$ broad

example: Sarah's desk has scattered papers, coffee stains, and a cluttered computer desktop. $$\therefore$$ Sarah is disorganized

## history of intelligence testing

- **reliability** - a reliable test produces the same result if one person takes it multiple times
- **validity** - a valid test actually measures the trait it is supposed to be measuring

first tests measured reaction time

then the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale was popularized measuring IQ

then howard gardner proposed 8 types of intelligence: verbal, mathematical, musical, spatial, kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, naturalistic. each type of intelligence is independent

there is no data to backup different "teaching styles" like visual, audio, etc.

## factors influencing human intelligence

big question: does intelligence come more from genes or environment

based on twins, genes do have an effect, and environment both have an influence 

- **flynn effect** - the mean raw score for IQ has been rising since 1932 by 9-15 points every 30 years
    - not know why

## Piaget and intelligence development

- **schema** - a mental framework for interpreting the world around us
- **assimilation** - incorporating new information into schemas
- **accommodation** - modifying existing schemas to fit incompatible information

### stages of cognitive development in children
1. sensory motor - 0-2 years - begins to act with intention. at the end: object permanence
2. preoperational - 2-7 years - 
    - works on egocentrism, 
    - seriation - logically order objects,
    - reversible relationships - a girl responds yes to "do you have a brother?", but might respond no to "does you brother have a sister?"
    - conservation - if you pour milk into a taller, narrower glass, the child will think there is more milk in the taller glass
3. concrete operational - 7-12 years - works on abstract thinking and reasoning 
4. formal operational - 12+ years - mostly done acquiring the range of adult cognitive abilities

### criticism
- sometimes skills are developed out of order
- research depended on language abilities

## biases and heuristics
our decisions can be prone to error and bias

- **confirmation bias** - only seeking evidence to confirm an assumption
- **heuristic** - mental shortcut
- **availability heuristic** - tendency to make decisions based on the information that is most quickly available to us
- **representativeness heuristic** -  our tendency to assume that what we are seeing is representative of the larger category we have in mind
