## web modules

- **goal of scientists** is to discover new information to understand how the world works
- **scientific method** - provides a standardized process for scientific research. This process minimizes biases, conflicts, and other problems in order to promote accurate results and scientific discourse.

    0. research existing information
    1. construct a theory - general set of ideas
    2. generate a hypothesis - testable statement that makes a prediction
    3. research method - choose how to test hypothesis
    4. collect data
    5. analyze data
    6. report findings
    7. revise theories - incorporate new information into our understanding of the world

### conducting experiments

- **independent variable** - variable manipulated by scientist
- **dependent variable** - variable observed by scientist, the result 
- **types of experiments**
    - **within participant design** - test on the same participant repeatedly
        - pros 
            - they act as there own control group so are sometimes more consistent
        - cons 
            - takes longer
            - **practice effect** - person can change over time and get better at a task
    - **between participant design** - uses two separate groups
        - experimental group - independent variable is tested on
        - control group - as similar to experimental group as possible
    - **observational research** - the experimenter does not cause anyone to change, they only record the results of different populations
- **cofounding variable** - A confounding variable is any variable associated with the independent variable that obscures the effects of the independent variable on the dependent variable. this variable makes it difficult to draw conclusions

### setting up experiments / factors that effect experiments

- **population** - group of people a study is being conducted about
- **sample** - the subset of people selected from the population
- **random sample** - a subset of people is selected randomly so everyone has an equal chance of being represented 
- **random assignment** - participants are randomly assigned to the control or experimental group to avoid bias
- **placebo effect** - the situation where an individual exhibits a response to a treatment that is not due to its real effect
- **participant bias** - participants change their behavior to align with the expected result or to be viewed differently
- **experimenter bias** - actions made by the experimenter influence the outcome of the experiment, intentional or not
- **blinding** - when participants do not know which group they belong to or which treatment they are receiving - to counter the placebo effect
- **double blind** - neither the participants nor the experimenter know which group each participant belongs to

### introduction to data analysis

- **descriptive statistics** - presents information about data that gives and overall idea of the result at a glance
- **histogram** - graph that reports the number of times a group of values appear in a data set
    - bins - ranges the x-axis is divided into
    - frequency - number of times a value appears in the set
- **normal distribution**

- **measures of central tendencies**
    - **mean** - average, susceptible to outliers - $$\frac{x1+x2+x3+x4+\ldots+x5}{n}$$
    - **mode** - the value that appears most frequently in the set, can be used with non numeric data
    - **median** - the center value in a data set when the set is sorted
- **measures of variability**
    - **standard deviation** - average distance of each data point from the mean, bigger means more spread out

### inferential statistics

Inferential statistics allow us to use results from samples to make inferences about overall underlying populations.

- **T test** - a statistical test that considers each data point from both groups to calculate the probability that two samples were drawn from the same population
    - **P value** - a the probability that the results would have been found even if the control and experimental groups actually come from the same population., less then 5% is usually required to be sure there is a "real" difference
- **statistical significance** - result is not due to random variation but a true difference
- **types of error**
    - **type 1 error** - false alarm - believing a difference exists when it does not - boy who cried wolf
    - **type 2 error** - miss - failing to see a difference when a difference does exist
- **corelation** - a measure of the strength of the relationship between two variables
- **corelation coefficient** - r variable - number between -1 and 1 indicating the strength and direction for correlation, vertical or horizontal line means no correlation, other then that, the slope of the line does not affect the r value

- **corelation does not equal causation**
