# attention

one definition of attention by William James: "I is the taking possession by the mind in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought... it implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others, and is a condition which has a real opposite in the confused, dazed, scatterbrained state 

- **selection** - the act of attending to an object to select it apart from the unattended objects

## automatic and controlled attention

- **automatic processes**
    - involuntary "capture"
    - fast, efficient
- **controlled processes**
    - conscious attention
    - slow, effortful

the resources for controlled processes are limited

- **salient information** - information that stands out automatically. examples: honking, screams, explosions

- **automatic attentional processing** - reacting automatically to information

## the spotlight model

conscious visual attention focuses like a spotlight

objects within the spotlight are processed faster and with greater accuracy

our attentional spotlight is automatically attracted to cues

Donald Broadbent suggests that only auditory information that is attended to pass the filter and is processed. There are contradictory findings that suggest that some information that is unattended passes the filter.

- **breakthrough** - when people remember unattended information

### dual filter model

2 filters:
- early physical filter - based on things like intensity and pitch, weighs the importance of all stimuli
- later semantic filter - considers the relevance and meaning of the stimuli 


## filter models

we use auditory cues to filter target sounds from background noise

filters suppress noise, unlike spotlights which enhance stimuli

## the stroop task

demonstrates that attention is facilitated by stimulus relevance

the stroop effect can be controlled

- **proportion congruent manipulation**
    - change the ratio of congruent to incongruent trials
    - 75% congruent, 25% incongruent $$\rightarrow$$ increased stroop effect
    - 25% congruent, 75% incongruent $$\rightarrow$$ decreased stroop effect

high congruency tests bias attention to task-irrelevant information

low congruency tests bias attention to task-relevant information

these test show that automatic processes can be consciously controlled

## visual search

- **set size** - the number of items to search through
- **set size effect** - increase in difficulty as set size increases

single feature search tasks are easier

- **pop out effect** - then the object of a visual search is easily found regardless of set size, easily induced by color

conjunction searches use two or mote features to create a more difficult task

we are good at day to day searches due to effects like contextual cuing by knowing where to search

## conclusion
