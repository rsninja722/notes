# influences of others

## presence of others

Norman Triplett first studied social phycology when he studied cyclists who cycled faster when racing against others vs. doing an independent time trial

- **co-actor** - another individual performing the same task
- **audience** - a group of people watching an individual
- **social facilitation** - the increased performance that occurs in the same presence of co-actors or an audience (regardless of their interest in the task)

some times the presence of others can have a positive, negative, or no effect

### the effect of other's presences

the presence of others increases your physiological activity which can lead to:

- an improvement in performance (mostly) on well practiced tasks
- a decrease in performance (mostly) on complex tasks

## social learning theory

children mimic observed behaviors, even when afflicting harm to other people

reinforcement isn't the only way people learn

## conformity

- **norms** - unwritten but commonly accepted rules for how to behave
- **norm formation** - when a certain behavior becomes typical amongst a group
- **normative function** - the role of others in setting standards for our conduct based on a fear of rejection
- **informational function** - the role of others in providing information about an ambiguous situation

## group dynamics

- **risky shift** - groups are either always more risky or less risky that an individual when making a decision, depending on the situation

- **group polarization** - group decision making strengthens the inclinations of the individual group members

- **group think** - a group decision making environment that occurs when group cohesiveness becomes so strong it overrides realistic appraisals of reality and alternative opinions

to prevent group think
1. be impartial as a leader
2. critical evaluation (devils advocate)
3. subdivide the group
4. provide a second chance for the group to discuss

## bystander effect

the presence of other witnesses leads to a diffusion of responsibility to act

- **pluralistic ignorance** - when each individual in a group sees nobody responding in a given situation, they conclude that the situation is not an emergency 

- **diffusion of responsibility** - in deciding whether we have to act, we determine that someone else in the group is more qualified

seeing helpful behavior increases your probability of helping others in the future, kindness is contagious

- **social loafing** - individuals seem to be les motivated when working in a group than when working alone

## obedience

### Milgrim's experiments

Milgrim's experiments demonstrated obedience to authority in a lab setting

In Milgrim's experiments, participants took the role of a teacher that was supposed to deliver electric shocks to a learner (who was a confederate of the experiment). The experimenter encouraged the participant to keep going no matter what saying things like "you must continue the experiment" and "the experiment requires you to continue". 

65% of participants continued shocking the learner even after they expressed concern about their heart condition, how they felt their heart was not feeling well, and eventually stopped all screaming and complaining

### takeaways
people display strong obedience, even to minimally powerful figures of authority

people are bad judges at predicting their own behavior

modern ethical codes prevent an experiment like this from taking place again

### further findings

changing location from a prestigious university to a rundown building did not produce statistically significantly change

changing the experimenter with a confederate dressed casually decreased the obedience

increasing the physical distance from the learner decreases obedience

increasing the proximity of the experimenter increased obedience

criminal background checks and tests for psychopathology, anti-social behaviors, etc. had no effect on the result

## cognitive dissonance

our attitudes aren't always accurately reflected in our behaviors

when following social norms or whats expected of us, the behavior doesn't always line up with our attitude

can our behavior change our attitude?

- **cognitive dissonance** - a state of physiological discomfort brought on by conflict between a person's attitudes and their behaviors

an experiment was ran where participants were told the experiment was going to be exciting after going through a boring experiment, participants were asked to tell the next participant that the experiment was exiting

results 

![results](./media/10_influence_of_others_1.png)

attitude | behavior | dissonance
---|---|---
thinks it's boring | says it's exciting (lie) | large dissonance
thinks it's interesting | says it's exiting | reduced dissonance

participants who were paid less had greater dissonance between attitude and behavior, so their attitude shifted to reduce cognitive dissonance
 
participants who were paid more could say they lied just for the money and still believe the experiment was boring

**for cognitive dissonance to take place** there must be insufficient justification for a behavior in conflict with an attitude

- **over justification effect** - the resolution of cognitive dissonance as conflict in behavior and attitude are justified by some external means
