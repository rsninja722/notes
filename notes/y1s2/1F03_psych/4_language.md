# language

## intro 

### characteristics of language
- regular: regulated by rules of grammar
- arbitrary: sound of words has no correlation to anything
- productive: almost limitless ways to combine words to describe objects, situations, and actions

### Sapir-Whorf hypothesis
some internal thoughts occur in the form of language

language influences our thoughts and the way we perceive and experience the world

not proven yet


## structure of a language
grammar forms the structure of human language and thought

- **morpheme** - the smallest unit of sound that contains information
    - often a word, but some words contain multiple morphemes. (table) = 1 morpheme, (table)(cloth) = 2 morphemes, (clean)(ing) = 2 morphemes. some morphemes need to have the context of other morphemes
- **phonemes** - the smallest unit of sound in a word. phonemes of dog are: /d/ /o/ /g/, phonemes of chair are: /ch/ /ai/ /r/
- **syntax/grammar** - the rules that govern how words in a sentence are put together
- **semantics** - meaning of an individual word
    - sentences can my syntactically correct without any semantic meaning. example: "the colorless green ideas sleep furiously beside the kwyjibo"

## development and the segmentation problems

language development milestones

aprox. time | achievement
:---: | :---:
8 weeks | cooing sounds; vowel sounds
16 weeks | turns head towards voices
6 months | begins babbling; adds consonant sounds
8 months | complex, non-random babbling
2 years | 50-250 words; uses 2-word phrases
2.5 years | vocabulary > 850 words
5-6 years | vocabulary > 10000 words

### segmentation
picking out separate words from a stream of speech

better segmentation skills are correlated with larger expressive vocabularies

## universal phoneme sensitivity
young infants can distinguish between more phonemes than adults

tested by seeing if an infant turns there head towards a sound

universal phoneme sensitivity in infants is mostly gone by 10-12 months


## theories of language development

### social learning theory
lack of early social interaction leads to an inability to develop language skills

### innate mechanism theory
language errors seen with children 
- **overextension** - applying rules too broadly. example: learns the past tense of play is played, so assumes the past tense of run is runned
- **underextension** - applying rules to individual occurrences. example: calling a toy rubber duck "duck", but not any other ducks

do all languages have a common innate set of rules?

Noam Chomsky proposed the following:
- **language acquisition device** - an innate mechanism, present only in humans, that helps language develop rapidly according to universal rules
    - children deaf from birth spontaneously develop a universal sign language without formally learn it
    - infants' brains are wired to listen to speech

## animal communication

### bee example
bees have a waggle dance to communicate where food is. the distance of the waggle represents the distance to the food, and the angle of the dance from the sun represents the direction pf the food

## difference between animal and human communication

### Washoe the chimp
Washoe was taught sign language and could successfully use signs to communicate simple requests and combine them to create more complex requests. 

arbitrary and productive, but not regular

### sarah the chimp
taught to use plastic symbols to communicate could create requests and answer questions, had a large vocabulary. could not combine symbols well

regular and arbitrary, but not productive

### kanzi the chimp

taught to use lexigrams through immersion in the language, learn by observation and picked up the language. could communicate some novel requests but had a limited grammar and could not combine lexigrams

arbitrary and productive, but not regular

### summary 
skeptics argue that true language requires the ability to combine words and meaning rich behaviors to express new ideas
