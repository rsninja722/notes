# Conditioning

## classical conditioning / pavlovian conditioning
Learning that one event accurately and reliably predicts the occurrence of a second event.

the learning of a contingency between a paticular signal and a later event that are paired in time and/or space

when a contingent relationship is learned, an organism can respond to the signal before the event occurs

### pavlov's famous experiment
pavlov noticed dogs would salivate at the sight of food, so he played a metronome every time before giving dogs food and they ended up salivating at the sound of the metronome

### components of classical conditioning 

we experience more then one type of learning
- **unconditioned stimulus** - a stimulus that triggers an response naturally without any learning
- **unconditioned response** - a response that occurs after the unconditioned stimulus, occurs naturally without learning, usually biological

- **conditioned stimulus** - paired with the unconditioned stimulus to produce a contingency. / a previously neutral stimulus that becomes associated with an unconditioned stimulus to eventually trigger a response on its own
- **conditioned response** - the response that occurs once the contingency between the CS and US has been learned. / a response to stimulus that is reinforced with repetition.
- **contingent relationship / contingencies** - when one stimulus reliably predicts the presentation of another

- **acquisition** - the process by which a contingency between a CS and US is learned

### extinction
the loss of the CR when the CS no longer predicts the US

by presenting the CS alone without the US that it had been previously paired with, a new inhibitory response is learned that can override the previous response

if repeated exposures to the CS stop for a period of time, it is possible that when another exposure happens, the CR can occur again

### generalizing and discrimination
in the real world, contingencies forming can be complicated and don't always involve 1 clear CS

if a child gets bit by one breed of dog, it may develop a fear of all breeds of dogs

generalization provides efficiency and flexibility, discrimination refines the learning process

- **stimulus generalization** - the process by which stimuli similar to the CS will also elicit a CR
- **stimulus discrimination** - when similar stimuli to the CS don't lead to CR. / When an organism learns to respond differently to various stimuli that are similar
- **cs +** - conditioned stimulus plus. a similar stimulus that leads to a US
- **cs -** - conditioned stimulus minus. a similar stimulus that does not lead to a US

- **implosive therapy** - imagining the CS in the absence of the US - may be traumatic
- **systematic desensitization** - gradual exposure to stimuli to reduce the strength of the CR

### homeostasis and compensatory responses

- **homeostasis** - self regulating process that the body does to try to maintain stability while adjusting to changing conditions
- **compensatory responses** - automatic response which is the opposite effect of something in order to try cancel it out

if someone routinely uses a drug at a certain time and location, the body will start trying to counter the effects of the drug as soon as it receives the stimulus of the location and time, it the person goes to the location and time and doesn't take the drug, the CR will cause them to feel the "opposite" effect of the drug
