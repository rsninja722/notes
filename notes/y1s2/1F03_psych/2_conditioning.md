# Conditioning

## classical conditioning / pavlovian conditioning
reflexive learning

Learning that one event accurately and reliably predicts the occurrence of a second event.

the learning of a contingency between a paticular signal and a later event that are paired in time and/or space

when a contingent relationship is learned, an organism can respond to the signal before the event occurs

### pavlov's famous experiment
pavlov noticed dogs would salivate at the sight of food, so he played a metronome every time before giving dogs food and they ended up salivating at the sound of the metronome

### components of classical conditioning 

we experience more then one type of learning
- **unconditioned stimulus** - a stimulus that triggers an response naturally without any learning
- **unconditioned response** - a response that occurs after the unconditioned stimulus, occurs naturally without learning, usually biological

- **conditioned stimulus** - paired with the unconditioned stimulus to produce a contingency. / a previously neutral stimulus that becomes associated with an unconditioned stimulus to eventually trigger a response on its own
- **conditioned response** - the response that occurs once the contingency between the CS and US has been learned. / a response to stimulus that is reinforced with repetition.
- **contingent relationship / contingencies** - when one stimulus reliably predicts the presentation of another

- **acquisition** - the process by which a contingency between a CS and US is learned

### extinction
the loss of the CR when the CS no longer predicts the US

by presenting the CS alone without the US that it had been previously paired with, a new inhibitory response is learned that can override the previous response

if repeated exposures to the CS stop for a period of time, it is possible that when another exposure happens, the CR can occur again

### generalizing and discrimination
in the real world, contingencies forming can be complicated and don't always involve 1 clear CS

if a child gets bit by one breed of dog, it may develop a fear of all breeds of dogs

generalization provides efficiency and flexibility, discrimination refines the learning process

- **stimulus generalization** - the process by which stimuli similar to the CS will also elicit a CR
- **stimulus discrimination** - when similar stimuli to the CS don't lead to CR. / When an organism learns to respond differently to various stimuli that are similar
- **cs +** - conditioned stimulus plus. a similar stimulus that leads to a US
- **cs -** - conditioned stimulus minus. a similar stimulus that does not lead to a US

- **implosive therapy** - imagining the CS in the absence of the US - may be traumatic
- **systematic desensitization** - gradual exposure to stimuli to reduce the strength of the CR

### homeostasis and compensatory responses

- **homeostasis** - self regulating process that the body does to try to maintain stability while adjusting to changing conditions
- **compensatory responses** - automatic response which is the opposite effect of something in order to try cancel it out

if someone routinely uses a drug at a certain time and location, the body will start trying to counter the effects of the drug as soon as it receives the stimulus of the location and time, it the person goes to the location and time and doesn't take the drug, the CR will cause them to feel the "opposite" effect of the drug

# instrumental conditioning / operant conditioning
explicit training


## original research
started with animals and focused only on behavior, not mental processes

Edward L. Thorndike was the first to research, he used cats in a puzzle box putting the focus on overt behavior

## behaviors in animals
- **stamp in** - favorable behaviors are slowly reinforced over time
- **stamp out** - unfavorable behaviors are slowly fazed out over time

- **law of effect** behaviors with positive consequences are stamped in, those with negative consequences are stamped out

## types of instrumental conditioning

### definitions
- **reinforcer** - any stimulus that is present after a response that impacts the frequency that the response is performed

increase in behavior | decrease in behavior 
:---: | :---: 
presentation of a positive reinforcer | removal of a positive reinforcer
removal of a negative reinforcer | presentation of a negative reinforcer

- **reward training** - presenting a positive reinforcer to encourage a behavior
- **punishment training** - presenting a negative reinforcer to discourage a behavior
    - risk of being unethical or distressing, the source of punishment might become a signal for fear or distress through classical conditioning
- **omission training** - removal of a positive reinforcer to discourage a behavior, it is not the same as punishment. a time-out is an example
- **escape training** - a removal of a negative reinforcer when a behavior is demonstrated after a constant negative reinforcer is applied to encourage a behavior 

the bigger time gap between a behavior and its consequence, the less effective the training

## acquisition and shaping
in instrumental learning, the process of acquisition leads to the learning the contingency between a response and its consequence.

- **response rate of behavior** - number of responses to training over time
- **autoshaping** - learning without direct guidance, example: food is released every time a pigeon presses a button
- **shaping** - used for behaviors that are too complex for auto shaping. complex behaviors are shaped over successive approximation. This complex behavior can be organized into smaller approximations which gradually build up to the full response. each approximation is reinforced through the presentation of a reward until the final complex behavior is achieved.
    - reinforced for improvement
- **chaining** - technique used to develop a sequence of behaviors. each behavior is reinforced with the opportunity to perform the next behavior in a sequence. example: leaning the alphabet
    - reinforced for correct order

## generalization and discrimination

### discrimination
contingencies are not always valid, different environments/people change whether or not a contingency is valid

It's not only important to learn the contingency between a response and reinforcement, but also when that contingency is valid.

- **discriminative stimulus / s+ / SD** - indicates when a contingency is valid
- **stimulus delta / s- / sδ** - indicates when a contingency is invalid

### generalization

Sδ altering the generalization gradient of the discriminative stimulus in a experiment where a bird receives food when pecking at a button when a light of a certain color is on

SD vs CS+ - CS+ elicits a reflexive, involuntary result. the SD sets the occasion for a voluntary response
