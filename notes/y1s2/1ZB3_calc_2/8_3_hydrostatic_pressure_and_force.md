# 8.3 hydrostatic pressure and force

## equation for hydrostatic force

for force exerted on horizontal plate with area A

$$F = \rho gAd$$

- $$\rho$$ = fluid density ($$1000 \enspace kg/m^3$$ for water)
- $$g$$ = acceleration due to gravity ($$9.8m/s^2$$)
- $$A$$ = area of plate
- $$d$$ = depth below water surface

## equation for pressure

$$P = \frac{F}{A} = \rho gd$$

works when every point on the plate is at the same depth

## total force for a vertical plate

the pressure is different at different depths, so we think of the force in small slices

step 1: choose a set of axes

step 2: slice up the wall into thin horizontal strips, with the same thickness $$\Delta y$$. what is the force acting on this strip?

force acting on ith strip: $$F_i = \rho g A_i d_i$$
