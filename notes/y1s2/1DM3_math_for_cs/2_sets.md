# set theory

## definitions
- set - unordered collection of elements/members. a set is said to contains elements/members
- $$a \in A$$ - a is an element of A
- $$a \notin A$$ - a is not an element of A

## describe a set
roster method: $$S = {a,b,c,d}$$ order doesn't matter, duplicates are ignored

$$S = {a,b,c,d, ... ,z}$$ ellipses can be used to describe a set without listing every element when the pattern is clear

$$S = { ... ,-3,-2,-1}$$: set of all integers less than zero, ellipses can be used at the start or end

## important sets
- $$\mathbb{N}$$ = natural numbers $${0,1,2,3, ...}$$
- $$\mathbb{Z}$$ = integers $$\set{ ... ,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3, ...} $$
- $$\mathbb{Z}^{+}$$ = positive integers $${1,2,3, ...}$$
- $$\mathbb{Q}$$ = ration numbers (fractions)
- $$\mathbb{R}$$ = real numbers (decimals)
- $$\mathbb{R}^{+}$$ = positive real numbers (decimals)
- $$\mathbb{C}$$ =  complex numbers



proving set identity

show that 
$$\overline{A \cap B} \subseteq \bar{A} \cup \bar{B}$$
