improper integral comparison

if g(x) diverges, and f(x) is bigger than g(x), then f(x) diverges
if g(x) converges, and f(x) is smaller than g(x), then f(x) converges

bigger than big is big
smaller than small is small
bigger then small or smaller than big doesn't mean anything


$a < b \to -a > -b$
$0 < a < b \to 0 < \frac{1}{b} < \frac{1}{a}$

basically find something bigger that converges or something smaller that diverges
