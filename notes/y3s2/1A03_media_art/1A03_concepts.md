# 1A03 concepts

- **multimedia** - combination of diverse media, especially digital media, into a coherent communicative or expressive object or experience

## 3 themes

- mediated observation (and being observed)
- media design as communication
- media modification

## form and content

- digital society: mixture of technologies behaviors and practices, not everyone is involved or participating
    - many aspects of life have become mediated by information and communication tech
    - these tech have effectively become a requirement of life

- medium
    - representations affect understanding

- harnessing distinctive features of a medium
    - identify features distinct to that medium and understand how they affect the media produced with them

### the medium is the message

McLuhan says: Don't just look at what's being expressed; look at the ways it's being expressed. And then Postman says: Don't just look at the way things are being expressed; look at how the way things are expressed determines what's actually expressible.'' In other words, the medium blocks certain messages

## digital society and surveillance

- **surveillance** - monitoring of behavior and activities of people or a group of people

### theorizing discipline

- **discipline** - submission of bodies and minds to the social organization of spaces and times
- **disciplinary institutions** - prison, asylum, school, hospital
- power is not identified with an individual, it is an apparatus

- society of control - breakdown in physical sites of confinement: confinements are replaced with controls

### surveillance and big data

- rosen notes: he is not the consumer but the product
- example: healthcare company data
    - 100,000,000,000+ medical records
    - 60+ petabytes of proprietary data
- genetic data
    - potentially used by insurance companies and crime investigations
- facial recognition
    -  appleID, clearview, FRT used for identity processing

## digital files

- **CODEC** - compression decompression
    - standard for encoding data into a file format, and how to read data from the file format

## digital audio

- **analog signal** - smooth curve
- **digital signal** - discrete samples
    - **sample rate** - samples per second, measured in kHz
        - common rates: CDs - 44.1 kHz, DVDs - 48kHz, high quality - 96kHz, 192kHz
    - **bit depth** - bits used to represent each sample, commonly 8-bit,16-bit
    - **bit rate** - transfer/playback speed
        - common rates: CDs - 1411 kbps, highest mp3 encoding - 320 kbps, streaming - 192/256 kbps, spoken audio - 96/128/160 kbps
    - uncompressed audio CODECs - WAV, AIFF, PCM, DSD
    - lossless audio CODECs - FLAC, ALAC, WMA
    - lossy audio CODECs - MP3, ACC, OGG

## graphic design

- **design** 
    - create, fashion, execute, or construct according to a plan
    - a preliminary sketch or outline showing the main features of something to be executed
- **graphic design** - creation of the visual conditions for making meaning
    - form + content = meaning
    - aesthetics - communicating visually through images, typography, color, shape, line, texture...
    - ideas - a visual language for communicating concepts

### world view

- **world view** - how we perceive and apprehend the world around us, from a specific standpoint
    - individual or societal orientation
    - how we interpret the world
- provides us with context/filter for extracting meaning
- design is created through the world-view lenses of their creator
    - their world view is imparted on the designed object/artifact
- some attempts to reflect a world view fail terribly (pepsi ad) 

### interpretation

- all graphic design is consumed through our world view
- **one measure of success** - can the viewer interpret the message being communicated
- **shared understanding** - regardless of personal world views, many understand and share certain codes and conventions 
- **norms** - design seeks to reflect or refute normative beliefs
    - can appeal or repel particular sensibilities 

### meaning

- **denotative meaning** - descriptive, what does it show?
- **connotative meaning** - communicative, what does it suggest/imply?

## principles and rules of graphic design

- form and/is content
    - form - structure, design. or arrangement of design
    - content - meaning or message contained in the work

1. have a concept
    - what are you going to say and how will you say it
2. communicate don't decorate
    -
3. speak with one visual voice
    - color, shape, scale, balance, typeface all work together
    - make all the parts talk to each other

## projects

### Media Project #1 (25%):

- Students will use a multimedia technology to document a thing or place that changes over time or something that occurs in multiple instances or places.
    - determine a presentation strategy (production and presentation)
    - reflect how the medium affects the mean
    - focus on observing
        - can't be apart, or direct
        - would happen regardless of your presence
    - no substantial edits
    - goals
        - provide opportunity for viewer to experience something familiar in a new way, draw attention to something not noticed before
        - reflect on broader themes and ideas
        - TODO
- ideas
    - multiple timelapses of high foot traffic area, accelerating timelapse
    - pictures of the forested path
        - different focus depths?
    - 10 pictures, 10 days, 10 times (every minute 25), different focus depths, stitch together unfocused/focused square bands

### Media Project #2 (25%):

- Students will choose a graphic designer from a list provided by the instructor, analyze their artistic language, and re-imagine it by creating a graphic composition, such as a book cover, a music album cover, movie poster. Full details on Avenue to Learn.

### Media Project #3 (25%):

- Critical analysis and approaches to participatory culture and remix approaches. In groups of 2 or 3, students will create a piece of experimental media using one or more production tools from a range, including Twine (interactive stories) and TidalCycles (electronic music). Students will document their work and produce an artist’s journal for their project. Full details on Avenue to Learn.
